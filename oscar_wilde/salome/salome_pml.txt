Salome

A TRAGEDY IN ONE ACT:

TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH OF

OSCAR WILDE,


SCENE.--_A great terrace in the Palace of Herod, set above the
banqueting-hall. Some soldiers are leaning over the balcony. To
the right there is a gigantic staircase, to the left, at the
back, an old cistern surrounded by a wall of green bronze.
Moonlight._

@l{"name":"The Young Syrian"}


How beautiful is the Princess Salomé to-night!


@l{"name":"The Page of Herodias"}


Look at the moon! How strange the moon seems! She is like a woman
rising from a tomb. She is like a dead woman. You would fancy she
was looking for dead things.


@l{"name":"The Young Syrian"}


She has a strange look. She is like a little princess who wears a
yellow veil, and whose feet are of silver. She is like a princess
who has little white doves for feet. You would fancy she was
dancing.


@l{"name":"The Page of Herodias"}


She is like a woman who is dead. She moves very slowly.


@d{}
[_Noise in the banqueting-hall._]


@l{"name":"First Soldier"}


What an uproar! Who are those wild beasts howling?


@l{"name":"Second Soldier"}


The Jews. They are always like that. They are disputing about
their religion.


@l{"name":"First Soldier"}


Why do they dispute about their religion?


@l{"name":"Second Soldier"}


I cannot tell. They are always doing it. The Pharisees, for
instance, say that there are angels, and the Sadducees declare
that angels do not exist.


@l{"name":"First Soldier"}


I think it is ridiculous to dispute about such things.


@l{"name":"The Young Syrian"}


How beautiful is the Princess Salomé to-night!


@l{"name":"The Page of Herodias"}


You are always looking at her. You look at her too much. It is
dangerous to look at people in such fashion. Something terrible
may happen.


@l{"name":"The Young Syrian"}


She is very beautiful to-night.


@l{"name":"First Soldier"}


The Tetrarch has a sombre look.


@l{"name":"Second Soldier"}


Yes; he has a sombre look.


@l{"name":"First Soldier"}


He is looking at something.


@l{"name":"Second Soldier"}


He is looking at some one.


@l{"name":"First Soldier"}


At whom is he looking?


@l{"name":"Second Soldier"}


I cannot tell.


@l{"name":"The Young Syrian"}


How pale the Princess is! Never have I seen her so pale. She is
like the shadow of a white rose in a mirror of silver.


@l{"name":"The Page of Herodias"}


You must not look at her. You look too much at her.


@l{"name":"First Soldier"}


Herodias has filled the cup of the Tetrarch.


@l{"name":"The Cappadocian"}


Is that the Queen Herodias, she who wears a black mitre sewn with
pearls, and whose hair is powdered with blue dust?


@l{"name":"First Soldier"}


Yes; that is Herodias, the Tetrarch's wife.


@l{"name":"Second Soldier"}


The Tetrarch is very fond of wine. He has wine of three sorts.
One which is brought from the Island of Samothrace, and is purple
like the cloak of Cæsar.


@l{"name":"The Cappadocian"}


I have never seen Cæsar.


@l{"name":"Second Soldier"}


Another that comes from a town called Cyprus, and is yellow like
gold.


@l{"name":"The Cappadocian"}


I love gold.


@l{"name":"Second Soldier"}


And the third is a wine of Sicily. That wine is red like blood.


@l{"name":"The Nubian"}


The gods of my country are very fond of blood. Twice in the year
we sacrifice to them young men and maidens; fifty young men and
a hundred maidens. But it seems we never give them quite enough,
for they are very harsh to us.


@l{"name":"The Cappadocian"}


In my country there are no gods left. The Romans have driven them
out. There are some who say that they have hidden themselves in
the mountains, but I do not believe it. Three nights I have been
on the mountains seeking them everywhere. I did not find them.
And at last I called them by their names, and they did not come.
I think they are dead.


@l{"name":"First Soldier"}


The Jews worship a God that you cannot see.


@l{"name":"The Cappadocian"}


I cannot understand that.


@l{"name":"First Soldier"}


In fact, they only believe in things that you cannot see.


@l{"name":"The Cappadocian"}


That seems to me altogether ridiculous.


@d{}
(offstage)

@l{"name":"Jokanaan"}
After me shall come another mightier than I. I am not worthy so
much as to unloose the latchet of his shoes. When he cometh, the
solitary places shall be glad. They shall blossom like the lily.
The eyes of the blind shall see the day, and the ears of the deaf
shall be opened. The new-born child shall put his hand upon the
dragon's lair, he shall lead the lions by their manes.


@l{"name":"Second Soldier"}


Make him be silent. He is always saying ridiculous things.


@l{"name":"First Soldier"}


No, no. He is a holy man. He is very gentle, too. Every day, when
I give him to eat he thanks me.


@l{"name":"The Cappadocian"}


Who is he?


@l{"name":"First Soldier"}


A prophet.


@l{"name":"The Cappadocian"}


What is his name?


@l{"name":"First Soldier"}


Jokanaan.


@l{"name":"The Cappadocian"}


Whence comes he?


@l{"name":"First Soldier"}


From the desert, where he fed on locusts and wild honey. He was
clothed in camel's hair, and round his loins he had a leathern
belt. He was very terrible to look upon. A great multitude used
to follow him. He even had disciples.


@l{"name":"The Cappadocian"}


What is he talking of?


@l{"name":"First Soldier"}


We can never tell. Sometimes he says terrible things, but it is
impossible to understand what he says.


@l{"name":"The Cappadocian"}


May one see him?


@l{"name":"First Soldier"}


No. The Tetrarch has forbidden it.


@l{"name":"The Young Syrian"}


The Princess has hidden her face behind her fan! Her little white
hands are fluttering like doves that fly to their dove-cots. They
are like white butterflies. They are just like white butterflies.


@l{"name":"The Page of Herodias"}


What is that to you? Why do you look at her? You must not look at
her.... Something terrible may happen.


@d{}
[_Pointing to the cistern._]


@l{"name":"The Cappadocian"}
What a strange prison!


@l{"name":"Second Soldier"}


It is an old cistern.


@l{"name":"The Cappadocian"}


An old cistern! It must be very unhealthy.


@l{"name":"Second Soldier"}


Oh no! For instance, the Tetrarch's brother, his elder brother,
the first husband of Herodias the Queen, was imprisoned there for
twelve years. It did not kill him. At the end of the twelve years
he had to be strangled.


@l{"name":"The Cappadocian"}


Strangled? Who dared to do that?


@d{}
[_Pointing to the Executioner, a huge Negro._]


@l{"name":"Second Soldier"}
That man yonder, Naaman.


@l{"name":"The Cappadocian"}


He was not afraid?


@l{"name":"Second Soldier"}


Oh no! The Tetrarch sent him the ring.


@l{"name":"The Cappadocian"}


What ring?



@l{"name":"Second Soldier"}


The death-ring. So he was not afraid.


@l{"name":"The Cappadocian"}


Yet it is a terrible thing to strangle a king.


@l{"name":"First Soldier"}


Why? Kings have but one neck, like other folk.


@l{"name":"The Cappadocian"}


I think it terrible.


@l{"name":"The Young Syrian"}


The Princess rises! She is leaving the table! She looks very
troubled. Ah, she is coming this way. Yes, she is coming towards
us. How pale she is! Never have I seen her so pale.


@l{"name":"The Page of Herodias"}


Do not look at her. I pray you not to look at her.


@l{"name":"The Young Syrian"}


She is like a dove that has strayed.... She is like a narcissus
trembling in the wind.... She is like a silver flower.


@d{}
[_Enter Salomé_.]


@e{"names":["Salome"]}

@l{"name":"Salome"}


I will not stay. I cannot stay. Why does the Tetrarch look at me
all the while with his mole's eyes under his shaking eyelids? It
is strange that the husband of my mother looks at me like that.
I know not what it means. In truth, yes, I know it.


@l{"name":"The Young Syrian"}


You have just left the feast, Princess?


@l{"name":"Salome"}


How sweet the air is here! I can breathe here! Within there are
Jews from Jerusalem who are tearing each other in pieces over
their foolish ceremonies, and barbarians who drink and drink, and
spill their wine on the pavement, and Greeks from Smyrna with
painted eyes and painted cheeks, and frizzed hair curled in
twisted coils, and silent, subtle Egyptians, with long nails of
jade and russett cloaks, and Romans brutal and coarse, with their
uncouth jargon. Ah! how I loathe the Romans! They are rough and
common, and they give themselves the airs of noble lords.


@l{"name":"The Young Syrian"}


Will you be seated, Princess?


@l{"name":"The Page of Herodias"}


Why do you speak to her? Why do you look at her? Oh! something
terrible will happen.


@l{"name":"Salome"}


How good to see the moon! She is like a little piece of money,
you would think she was a little silver flower. The moon is cold
and chaste. I am sure she is a virgin, she has a virgin's beauty.
Yes, she is a virgin. She has never defiled herself. She has
never abandoned herself to men, like the other goddesses.


@d{}
(offstage)

@l{"name":"Jokanaan"}
The Lord hath come. The son of man hath come. The centaurs have
hidden themselves in the rivers, and the sirens have left the
rivers, and are lying beneath the leaves of the forest.


@l{"name":"Salome"}


Who was that who cried out?


@l{"name":"Second Soldier"}


The prophet, Princess.


@l{"name":"Salome"}


Ah, the prophet! He of whom the Tetrarch is afraid?


@l{"name":"Second Soldier"}


We know nothing of that, Princess. It was the prophet Jokanaan
who cried out.


@l{"name":"The Young Syrian"}


Is it your pleasure that I bid them bring your litter, Princess?
The night is fair in the garden.


@l{"name":"Salome"}


He says terrible things about my mother, does he not?


@l{"name":"Second Soldier"}


We never understand what he says, Princess.


@l{"name":"Salome"}


Yes; he says terrible things about her.


@d{}
[_Enter a Slave_.]


@e{"names":["The Slave"]}

@l{"name":"The Slave"}


Princess, the Tetrarch prays you to return to the feast.


@l{"name":"Salome"}


I will not go back.


@l{"name":"The Young Syrian"}


Pardon me, Princess, but if you do not return some misfortune may
happen.


@l{"name":"Salome"}


Is he an old man, this prophet?


@l{"name":"The Young Syrian"}


Princess, it were better to return. Suffer me to lead you in.


@l{"name":"Salome"}


This prophet ... is he an old man?


@l{"name":"First Soldier"}


No, Princess, he is quite a young man.


@l{"name":"Second Soldier"}


You cannot be sure. There are those who say he is Elias.


@l{"name":"Salome"}


Who is Elias?


@l{"name":"Second Soldier"}


A very ancient prophet of this country, Princess.


@l{"name":"The Slave"}


What answer may I give the Tetrarch from the Princess?


@d{}
(offstage)

@l{"name":"Jokanaan"}
Rejoice not thou, land of Palestine, because the rod of him who
smote thee is broken. For from the seed of the serpent shall come
forth a basilisk, and that which is born of it shall devour the
birds.


@l{"name":"Salome"}


What a strange voice! I would speak with him.


@l{"name":"First Soldier"}


I fear it is impossible, Princess. The Tetrarch does not wish any
one to speak with him. He has even forbidden the high priest to
speak with him.


@l{"name":"Salome"}


I desire to speak with him.


@l{"name":"First Soldier"}


It is impossible, Princess.


@l{"name":"Salome"}


I will speak with him.


@l{"name":"The Young Syrian"}


Would it not be better to return to the banquet?


@l{"name":"Salome"}


Bring forth this prophet.

                             
@d{}
[_Exit the slave._]


@x{"names":["The Slave"]}

@l{"name":"First Soldier"}


We dare not, Princess.


@d{}
[_Approaching the cistern and looking down into it._]


@l{"name":"Salome"}
How black it is, down there! It must be terrible to be in so
black a pit! It is like a tomb.... 
@d{}
[_To the soldiers._] 
@l{"name":"Salome"}
Did you
not hear me? Bring out the prophet. I wish to see him.


@l{"name":"Second Soldier"}


Princess, I beg you do not require this of us.


@l{"name":"Salome"}


You keep me waiting!


@l{"name":"First Soldier"}


Princess, our lives belong to you, but we cannot do what you have
asked of us. And indeed, it is not of us that you should ask this
thing.


@d{}
[_Looking at the young Syrian._]


@l{"name":"Salome"}
Ah!


@l{"name":"The Page of Herodias"}


Oh! what is going to happen? I am sure that some misfortune will
happen.


@d{}
[_Going up to the young Syrian._]


@l{"name":"Salome"}
You will do this tiling for me, will you not, Narraboth? You will
do this thing for me. I have always been kind to you. You will do
it for me. I would but look at this strange prophet. Men have
talked so much of him. Often have I heard the Tetrarch talk of
him. I think the Tetrarch is afraid of him. Are you, even you,
also afraid of him, Narraboth?


@l{"name":"The Young Syrian"}


I fear him not, Princess; there is no man I fear. But the
Tetrarch has formally forbidden that any man should raise the
cover of this well.


@l{"name":"Salome"}


You will do this thing for me, Narraboth, and to-morrow when I
pass in my litter beneath the gateway of the idol-sellers I will
let fall for you a little flower, a little green flower.


@l{"name":"The Young Syrian"}


Princess, I cannot, I cannot.


@d{}
[_Smiling_.]


@l{"name":"Salome"}
You will do this thing for me, Narraboth. You know that you will
do this thing for me. And to-morrow when I pass in my litter by
the bridge of the idol-buyers, I will look at you through the
muslin veils, I will look at you, Narraboth, it may be I will
smile at you. Look at me, Narraboth, look at me. Ah! you know
that you will do what I ask of you. You know it well.... I know
that you will do this thing.


@d{}
[_Signing to the third soldier._]


@l{"name":"The Young Syrian"}
Let the prophet come forth.... The Princess Salomé desires to see
him.


@l{"name":"Salome"}


Ah!


@l{"name":"The Page of Herodias"}


Oh! How strange the moon looks. You would think it was the hand
of a dead woman who is seeking to cover herself with a shroud.


@l{"name":"The Young Syrian"}


She has a strange look! She is like a little princess, whose eyes
are eyes of amber. Through the clouds of muslin she is smiling
like a little princess.


@d{}
[_The prophet comes out of the cistern. Salomé looks at him and
steps slowly back._]



@e{"names":["Jokanaan"]}

@l{"name":"Jokanaan"}


Where is he whose cup of abominations is now full? Where is he,
who in a robe of silver shall one day die in the face of all the
people? Bid him come forth, that he may hear the voice of him who
hath cried in the waste places and in the houses of kings.


@l{"name":"Salome"}


Of whom is he speaking?


@l{"name":"The Young Syrian"}


You can never tell, Princess.


@l{"name":"Jokanaan"}


Where is she who having seen the images of men painted on the
walls, the images of the Chaldeans limned in colours, gave
herself up unto the lust of her eyes, and sent ambassadors into
Chaldea?


@l{"name":"Salome"}


It is of my mother that he speaks.


@l{"name":"The Young Syrian"}


Oh, no, Princess.


@l{"name":"Salome"}


Yes; it is of my mother that he speaks.


@l{"name":"Jokanaan"}


Where is she who gave herself unto the Captains of Assyria, who
have baldricks on their loins, and tiaras of divers colours on
their heads? Where is she who hath given herself to the young men
of Egypt, who are clothed in fine linen and purple, whose shields
are of gold, whose helmets are of silver, whose bodies are
mighty? Bid her rise up from the bed of her abominations, from
the bed of her incestuousness, that she may hear the words of him
who prepareth the way of the Lord, that she may repent her of her
iniquities. Though she will never repent, but will stick fast in
her abominations; bid her come, for the fan of the Lord is in His
hand.


@l{"name":"Salome"}


But he is terrible, he is terrible!


@l{"name":"The Young Syrian"}


Do not stay here, Princess, I beseech you.


@l{"name":"Salome"}


It is his eyes above all that are terrible. They are like black
holes burned by torches in a Tyrian tapestry. They are like black
caverns where dragons dwell. They are like the black caverns of
Egypt in which the dragons make their lairs. They are like black
lakes troubled by fantastic moons.... Do you think he will speak
again?


@l{"name":"The Young Syrian"}


Do not stay here, Princess. I pray you do not stay here.


@l{"name":"Salome"}


How wasted he is! He is like a thin ivory statue. He is like an
image of silver. I am sure he is chaste as the moon is. He is
like a moonbeam, like a shaft of silver. His flesh must be cool
like ivory. I would look closer at him.


@l{"name":"The Young Syrian"}


No, no, Princess.


@l{"name":"Salome"}


I must look at him closer.


@l{"name":"The Young Syrian"}


Princess! Princess!


@l{"name":"Jokanaan"}


Who is this woman who is looking at me? I will not have her look
at me. Wherefore doth she look at me with her golden eyes, under
her gilded eyelids? I know not who she is. I do not wish to know
who she is. Bid her begone. It is not to her that I would speak.


@l{"name":"Salome"}


I am Salomé, daughter of Herodias, Princess of Judæa.


@l{"name":"Jokanaan"}


Back! daughter of Babylon! Come not near the chosen of the Lord.
Thy mother hath filled the earth with the wine of her iniquities,
and the cry of her sins hath come up to the ears of God.


@l{"name":"Salome"}


Speak again, Jokanaan. Thy voice is wine to me.


@l{"name":"The Young Syrian"}


Princess! Princess! Princess!


@l{"name":"Salome"}


Speak again! Speak again, Jokanaan, and tell me what I must do.


@l{"name":"Jokanaan"}


Daughter of Sodom, come not near me! But cover thy face with a
veil, and scatter ashes upon thine head, and get thee to the
desert and seek out the Son of Man.


@l{"name":"Salome"}


Who is he, the Son of Man? Is he as beautiful as thou art,
Jokanaan?


@l{"name":"Jokanaan"}


Get thee behind me! I hear in the palace the beating of the wings
of the angel of death.


@l{"name":"The Young Syrian"}


Princess, I beseech thee to go within.


@l{"name":"Jokanaan"}


Angel of the Lord God, what dost thou here with thy sword? Whom
seekest thou in this foul palace? The day of him who shall die in
a robe of silver has not yet come.



@l{"name":"Salome"}


Jokanaan!


@l{"name":"Jokanaan"}


Who speaketh?


@l{"name":"Salome"}


Jokanaan, I am amorous of thy body! Thy body is white like the
lilies of a field that the mower hath never mowed. Thy body is
white like the snows that lie on the mountains, like the snows
that lie on the mountains of Judæa, and come down into the
valleys. The roses in the garden of the Queen of Arabia are not
so white as thy body. Neither the roses in the garden of the
Queen of Arabia, the perfumed garden of spices of the Queen of
Arabia, nor the feet of the dawn when they light on the leaves,
nor the breast of the moon when she lies on the breast of the
sea.... There is nothing in the world so white as thy body. Let
me touch thy body.


@l{"name":"Jokanaan"}


Back! daughter of Babylon! By woman came evil into the world.
Speak not to me. I will not listen to thee. I listen but to the
voice of the Lord God.


@l{"name":"Salome"}


Thy body is hideous. It is like the body of a leper. It is like a
plastered wall where vipers have crawled; like a plastered wall
where the scorpions have made their nest. It is like a whitened
sepulchre full of loathsome things. It is horrible, thy body is
horrible. It is of thy hair that I am enamoured, Jokanaan. Thy
hair is like clusters of grapes, like the clusters of black
grapes that hang from the vine-trees of Edom in the land of the
Edomites. Thy hair is like the cedars of Lebanon, like the great
cedars of Lebanon that give their shade to the lions and to the
robbers who would hide themselves by day. The long black nights,
when the moon hides her face, when the stars are afraid, are not
so black. The silence that dwells in the forest is not so black.
There is nothing in the world so black as thy hair.... Let me
touch thy hair.


@l{"name":"Jokanaan"}


Back, daughter of Sodom! Touch me not. Profane not the temple of
the Lord God.


@l{"name":"Salome"}


Thy hair is horrible. It is covered with mire and dust. It is
like a crown of thorns which they have placed on thy forehead. It
is like a knot of black serpents writhing round thy neck. I love
not thy hair.... It is thy mouth that I desire, Jokanaan. Thy
mouth is like a band of scarlet on a tower of ivory. It is like a
pomegranate cut with a knife of ivory. The pomegranate-flowers
that blossom in the gardens of Tyre, and are redder than roses,
are not so red. The red blasts of trumpets that herald the
approach of kings, and make afraid the enemy, are not so red.
Thy mouth is redder than the feet of those who tread the wine in
the wine-press. Thy mouth is redder than the feet of the doves
who haunt the temples and are fed by the priests. It is redder
than the feet of him who cometh from a forest where he hath slain
a lion, and seen gilded tigers. Thy mouth is like a branch of
coral that fishers have found in the twilight of the sea, the
coral that they keep for the kings!... It is like the vermilion
that the Moabites find in the mines of Moab, the vermilion that
the kings take from them. It is like the bow of the King of the
Persians, that is painted with vermilion, and is tipped with
coral. There is nothing in the world so red as thy mouth.... Let
me kiss thy mouth.


@l{"name":"Jokanaan"}


Never! daughter of Babylon! Daughter of Sodom! Never.


@l{"name":"Salome"}

The young Syrian has slain himself! The young captain has slain

little box of perfumes and ear-rings wrought in silver, and now
he has killed himself! Ah, did he not foretell that some
misfortune would happen? I, too, foretold it, and it has
happened. Well I knew that the moon was seeking a dead thing, but
I knew not that it was he whom she sought. Ah! why did I not hide
him from the moon? If I had hidden him in a cavern she would not

Daughter of adultery, there is but one who can save thee, it is

Galilee, and He talketh with His disciples. Kneel down on the
shore of the sea, and call unto Him by His name. When He cometh
to thee (and to all who call on Him He cometh), bow thyself at
His feet and ask of Him the remission of thy sins.

He was my brother, and nearer to me than a brother. I gave him a
little box full of perfumes, and a ring of agate that he wore
always on his hand. In the evening we used to walk by the river,
among the almond trees, and he would tell me of the things of his
country. He spake ever very low. The sound of his voice was like
the sound of the flute, of a flute player. Also he much loved to
gaze at himself in the river. I used to reproach him for that.


@l{"name":"Second Soldier"}


You are right; we must hide the body. The Tetrarch must not see
it.

She is like a mad woman, a mad woman who is seeking everywhere

We do not know, sire. But he killed himself.

That seems strange to me. I thought it was only the Roman

that the philosophers at Rome kill themselves?

There are some who kill themselves, sire. They are the Stoics.
The Stoics are coarse people. They are ridiculous people. I

I also. It is ridiculous to kill oneself.

Everybody at Rome laughs at them. The Emperor has written a

His father was a king. I drove him from his kingdom. And you made

I am not afraid of him. I am afraid of no man.

why do you not deliver him to the Jews, who for these six months

@l{"name":"First Jew"}


Truly, my lord, it were better to deliver him into our hands.


@l{"name":"Herod"}


Enough on this subject. I have already given you my answer. I
will not deliver him into your hands. He is a holy man. He is a
man who has seen God.


@l{"name":"First Jew"}


That cannot be. There is no man who hath seen God since the
prophet Elias. He is the last man who saw God. In these days God
doth not show Himself. He hideth Himself. Therefore great evils
have come upon the land.


@l{"name":"Second Jew"}


Verily, no man knoweth if Elias the prophet did indeed see God.
Peradventure it was but the shadow of God that he saw.


@l{"name":"Third Jew"}


God is at no time hidden. He showeth Himself at all times and in
everything. God is in what is evil even as He is in what is good.


@l{"name":"Fourth Jew"}


That must not be said. It is a very dangerous doctrine. It is a
doctrine that cometh from the schools at Alexandria, where men
teach the philosophy of the Greeks. And the Greeks are Gentiles:
They are not even circumcised.


@l{"name":"Fifth Jew"}


No one can tell how God worketh. His ways are very mysterious. It
may be that the things which we call evil are good, and that the
things which we call good are evil. There is no knowledge of any
thing. We must needs submit to everything, for God is very
strong. He breaketh in pieces the strong together with the weak,
for He regardeth not any man.


@l{"name":"First Jew"}


Thou speaketh truly. God is terrible; He breaketh the strong and
the weak as a man brays corn in a mortar. But this man hath never
seen God. No man hath seen God since the prophet Elias.


@l{"name":"Herodias"}


Make them be silent. They weary me.

But Cæsar is not coming into Judæa. Only yesterday I received

And you, Tigellinus, who were at Rome during the winter, you
heard nothing concerning this matter, did you?


@l{"name":"Tigellinus"}


Sire, I heard nothing concerning the matter. I was explaining the
title. It is one of Cæsar's titles.


@l{"name":"Herod"}


But Cæsar cannot come. He is too gouty. They say that his feet

Cæsar is lord, he will come if he wishes. Nevertheless, I do not

changed water into wine. Certain persons who were present related
it to me. Also He healed two lepers that were seated before the
Gate of Capernaum simply by touching them.


@l{"name":"Second Nazarene"}


Nay, it was blind men that he healed at Capernaum.

The daughter of Jairus was dead. He raised her from the dead.


@l{"name":"Herod"}


He raises the dead?


@l{"name":"First Nazarene"}


Yea, sire, He raiseth the dead.


@l{"name":"Herod"}


I do not wish Him to do that. I forbid Him to do that. I allow no
man to raise the dead. This Man must be found and told that I
forbid Him to raise the dead. Where is this Man at present?


@l{"name":"Second Nazarene"}


He is in every place, my lord, but it is hard to find Him.


@l{"name":"First Nazarene"}


It is said that He is now in Samaria.


@l{"name":"First Jew"}


It is easy to see that this is not Messias, if He is in Samaria.
It is not to the Samaritans that Messias shall come. The
Samaritans are accursed. They bring no offerings to the Temple.


@l{"name":"Second Nazarene"}


He left Samaria a few days since. I think that at the present
moment He is in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem.


@l{"name":"First Nazarene"}


No; He is not there. I have just come from Jerusalem. For two
months they have had no tidings of Him.


@l{"name":"Herod"}


No matter! But let them find Him, and tell Him from me, I will
not allow him to raise the dead! To change water into wine, to
heal the lepers and the blind.... He may do these things if He
will. I say nothing against these things. In truth I hold it a
good deed to heal a leper. But I allow no man to raise the dead.

most precious gifts. Also he has promised me to summon to Rome
the King of Cappadocia, who is my enemy. It may be that at Rome
he will crucify him, for he is able to do all things that he
wishes. Verily, Cæsar is lord. Thus you see I have a right to be
happy. Indeed, I am happy. I have never been so happy. There is
nothing in the world that can mar my happiness.

I am sterile, I? You say that, you that are ever looking at my

Peace, woman! I say that you are sterile. You have borne me no

that will bring evils.... I fear he is right; I am sure that he

black bird that hovers over the terrace. Why can I not see it,
this bird? The beat of its wings is terrible. The breath of the
wind of its wings is terrible. It is a chill wind. Nay, but it is
not cold, it is hot. I am choking. Pour water on my hands. Give

And I have never broken my word. I am not of those who break

and my word is the word of a king. The King of Cappadocia always
lies, but he is no true king. He is a coward. Also he owes me
money that he will not repay. He has even insulted my
ambassadors. He has spoken words that were wounding. But Cæsar
will crucify him when he comes to Rome. I am sure that Cæsar will
crucify him. And if not, yet will he die, being eaten of worms.

I know it. I have sworn by my gods. I know it well. But I pray

daughter. He has sworn, he has sworn.

Be silent, speak not to me!... Come, Salomé, be reasonable. I
have never been hard to you. I have ever loved you.... It may be
that I have loved you too much. Therefore ask not this thing of
me. This is a terrible thing, an awful thing to ask of me.
Surely, I think thou art jesting. The head of a man that is cut
from his body is ill to look upon, is it not? It is not meet
that the eyes of a virgin should look upon such a thing. What
pleasure could you have in it? None. No, no, it is not what you
desire. Hearken to me. I have an emerald, a great round emerald,
which Cæsar's minion sent me. If you look through this emerald
you can see things which happen at a great distance. Cæsar
himself carries such an emerald when he goes to the circus. But
my emerald is larger. I know well that it is larger. It is the
largest emerald in the whole world. You would like that, would
you not? Ask it of me and I will give it you.

The head of Jokanaan.


@l{"name":"Herod"}


No, no, you would not have that. You say that to trouble me,
because I have looked at you all this evening. It is true, I have
looked at you all this evening. Your beauty troubled me. Your
beauty has grievously troubled me, and I have looked at you too
much. But I will look at you no more. Neither at things, nor at
people should one look. Only in mirrors should one look, for
mirrors do but show us masks. Oh! oh! bring wine! I thirst....
Salomé, Salomé, let us be friends. Come now!... Ah! what would I
say? What was't? Ah! I remember!... Salomé--nay, but come nearer
to me; I fear you will not hear me--Salomé, you know my white
peacocks, my beautiful white peacocks, that walk in the garden
between the myrtles and the tall cypress trees. Their beaks are
gilded with gold, and the grains that they eat are gilded with
gold also, and their feet are stained with purple. When they cry
out the rain comes, and the moon shows herself in the heavens
when they spread their tails. Two by two they walk between the
cypress trees and the black myrtles, and each has a slave to tend
it. Sometimes they fly across the trees, and anon they crouch in
the grass, and round the lake. There are not in all the world
birds so wonderful. There is no king in all the world who
possesses such wonderful birds. I am sure that Cæsar himself has
no birds so fair as my birds. I will give you fifty of my
peacocks. They will follow you whithersoever you go, and in the
midst of them you will be like the moon in the midst of a great
white cloud.... I will give them all to you. I have but a
hundred, and in the whole world there is no king who has peacocks
like unto my peacocks. But I will give them all to you. Only you
must loose me from my oath, and must not ask of me that which you
have asked of me.

Be silent! You cry out always; you cry out like a beast of prey.
You must not. Your voice wearies me. Be silent, I say Salomé,
think of what you are doing. This man comes perchance from God.
He is a holy man. The finger of God has touched him. God has put
into his mouth terrible words. In the palace as in the desert God
is always with him.... At least it is possible. One does not
know. It is possible that God is for him and with him.
Furthermore, if he died some misfortune might happen to me. In
any case, he said that the day he dies a misfortune will happen
to some one. That could only be to me. Remember, I slipped in
blood when I entered. Also, I heard a beating of wings in the
air, a beating of mighty wings. These are very evil omens, and
there were others. I am sure there were others though I did not
see them. Well, Salomé, you do not wish a misfortune to happen to
me? You do not wish that. Listen to me, then.

Ah! you are not listening to me. Be calm. I--I am calm. I am
quite calm. Listen. I have jewels hidden in this place--jewels
that your mother even has never seen; jewels that are marvellous.
I have a collar of pearls, set in four rows. They are like unto
moons chained with rays of silver. They are like fifty moons
caught in a golden net. On the ivory of her breast a queen has
worn it. Thou shalt be as fair as a queen when thou wearest it. I
have amethysts of two kinds, one that is black like wine, and one
that is red like wine which has been coloured with water. I have
topazes, yellow as are the eyes of tigers, and topazes that are
pink as the eyes of a wood-pigeon, and green topazes that are as
the eyes of cats. I have opals that burn always, with an icelike
flame, opals that make sad men's minds, and are fearful of the
shadows. I have onyxes like the eyeballs of a dead woman. I have
moonstones that change when the moon changes, and are wan when
they see the sun. I have sapphires big like eggs, and as blue as
blue flowers. The sea wanders within them and the moon comes
never to trouble the blue of their waves. I have chrysolites and
beryls and chrysoprases and rubies. I have sardonyx and hyacinth
stones, and stones of chalcedony, and I will give them all to
you, all, and other things will I add to them. The King of the
Indies has but even now sent me four fans fashioned from the
feathers of parrots, and the King of Numidia a garment of ostrich
feathers. I have a crystal, into which it is not lawful for a
woman to look, nor may young men behold it until they have been
beaten with rods. In a coffer of nacre I have three wondrous
turquoises. He who wears them on his forehead can imagine things
which are not, and he who carries them in his hand can make women
sterile. These are great treasures above all price. They are
treasures without price. But this is not all. In an ebony coffer
I have two cups of amber, that are like apples of gold. If an
enemy pour poison into these cups, they become like an apple of
silver. In a coffer incrusted with amber I have sandals incrusted
with glass. I have mantles that have been brought from the land
of the Seres, and bracelets decked about with carbuncles and with
jade that come from the city of Euphrates.... What desirest thou
more than this, Salomé? Tell me the thing that thou desirest, and
I will give it thee. All that thou askest I will give thee, save
one thing. I will give thee all that is mine, save one life. I
will give thee the mantle of the high priest. I will give thee
the veil of the sanctuary.

wherefore dost thou not look at me, Jokanaan? Thine eyes that
were so terrible, so full of rage and scorn, are shut now.
Wherefore are they shut? Open thine eyes! Lift up thine eyelids,
Jokanaan! Wherefore dost thou not look at me? Art thou afraid of
me, Jokanaan, that thou wilt not look at me?... And thy tongue,
that was like a red snake darting poison, it moves no more, it
says nothing now, Jokanaan, that scarlet viper that spat its
venom upon me. It is strange, is it not? How is it that the red
viper stirs no longer?... Thou wouldst have none of me, Jokanaan.
Thou didst reject me. Thou didst speak evil words against me.
Thou didst treat me as a harlot, as a wanton, me, Salomé,
daughter of Herodias, Princess of Judæa! Well, Jokanaan, I still
live, but thou, thou art dead, and thy head belongs to me. I can
do with it what I will. I can throw it to the dogs and to the
birds of the air. That which the dogs leave, the birds of the air
shall devour.... Ah, Jokanaan, Jokanaan, thou wert the only man
that I have loved. All other men are hateful to me. But thou,
thou wert beautiful! Thy body was a column of ivory set on a
silver socket. It was a garden full of doves and of silver
lilies. It was a tower of silver decked with shields of ivory.
There was nothing in the world so white as thy body. There was
nothing in the world so black as thy hair. In the whole world
there was nothing so red as thy mouth. Thy voice was a censer
that scattered strange perfumes, and when I looked on thee I
heard a strange music. Ah! wherefore didst thou not look at me,
Jokanaan? Behind thine hands and thy curses thou didst hide thy
face. Thou didst put upon thine eyes the covering of him who
would see his God. Well, thou hast seen thy God, Jokanaan, but
me, me, thou didst never see. If thou hadst seen me thou wouldst
have loved me. I, I saw thee, Jokanaan, and I loved thee. Oh, how
I loved thee! I love thee yet, Jokanaan, I love thee only.... I
am athirst for thy beauty; I am hungry for thy body; and neither
wine nor fruits can appease my desire. What shall I do now,
Jokanaan? Neither the floods nor the great waters can quench my
passion. I was a princess, and thou didst scorn me. I was a
virgin, and thou didst take my virginity from me. I was chaste,
and thou didst fill my veins with fire.... Ah! ah! wherefore
didst thou not look at me, Jokanaan? If thou hadst looked at me
thou hadst loved me. Well I know that thou wouldst have loved me,
and the mystery of love is greater than the mystery of death.
Love only should one consider.
