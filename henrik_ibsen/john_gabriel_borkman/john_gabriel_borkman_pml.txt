JOHN GABRIEL BORKMAN
by
HENRIK IBSEN

The action passes one winter evening, at the Manorhouse of
  the Rentheim family, in the neighbourhood of Christiania.


ACT FIRST


MRS. BORKMAN's drawing-room, furnished with old-fashioned, faded
    splendour.  At the back, an open sliding-door leads into a
    garden-room, with windows and a glass door.  Through it a view
    over the garden; twilight with driving snow.  On the right,
    a door leading from the hall.  Further forward, a large
    old-fashioned iron stove, with the fire lighted.  On the left,
    towards the back, a single smaller door.  In front, on the
    same side, a window, covered with thick curtains.  Between
    the window and the door a horsehair sofa, with a table in
    front of it covered with a cloth.  On the table, a lighted
    lamp with a shade.  Beside the stove a high-backed armchair.

MRS. GUNHILD BORKMAN sits on the sofa, crocheting.  She is an
    elderly lady, of cold, distinguished appearance, with stiff
    carriage and immobile features.  Her abundant hair is very
    grey.  Delicate transparent hands.  Dressed in a gown of
    heavy dark silk, which has originally been handsome, but
    is now somewhat worn and shabby.  A woollen shawl over her
    shoulders.

She sits for a time erect and immovable at her crochet.  Then the
    bells of a passing sledge are heard.



@e{"names":["Mrs. Borkman"]}

@d{}
[Listens; her eyes sparkle with gladness and she involuntarily
whispers].  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Erhart!  At last!

    
@d{}
[She rises and draws the curtain a little aside to look out.
        Appears disappointed, and sits down to her work again, on
        the sofa.  Presently THE MAID enters from the hall with a
        visiting card on a small tray.


@e{"names":["The Maid"]}

@d{}
[Quickly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Has Mr. Erhart come after all?


@l{"name":"The Maid"}

  No, ma'am.  But there's a lady----


@d{}
[Laying aside her crochet.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Oh, Mrs. Wilton, I suppose----


@d{}
[Approaching.]  
@l{"name":"The Maid"}
No, it's a strange lady----


@d{}
[Taking the card.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Let me see---- 
@d{}
[Reads it; rises hastily and
looks intently at the girl.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Are you sure this is for me?


@l{"name":"The Maid"}

  Yes, I understand it was for you, ma'am.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Did she say she wanted to see Mrs. Borkman?


@l{"name":"The Maid"}

  Yes, she did.


@d{}
[Shortly, resolutely.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Good.  Then say I am at home.

    
@d{}
[THE MAID opens the door for the strange lady and goes out.
        MISS ELLA RENTHEIM enters.  She resembles her sister; but
        her face has rather a suffering than a hard expression.
        It still shows signs of great beauty, combined with strong
        character.  She has a great deal of hair, which is drawn
        back from the forehead in natural ripples, and is snow-white.
        She is dressed in black velvet, with a hat and a fur-lined
        cloak of the same material.

    [The two sisters stand silent for a time, and look searchingly
        at each other.  Each is evidently waiting for the other to
        speak first.


@e{"names":["Ella Rentheim"]}

@x{"names":["The Maid"]}

@d{}
[Who has remained near the door.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
You are surprised to see me,
Gunhild.


@d{}
[Standing erect and immovable between the sofa and the table,
resting her finger-tips upon the cloth.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Have you not made a
mistake?  The bailiff lives in the side wing, you know.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  It is not the bailiff I want to see to-day.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Is it me you want, then?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes.  I have a few words to say to you.


@d{}
[Coming forward into the middle of the room.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Well--then
sit down.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Thank you.  I can quite well stand for the present.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Just as you please.  But at least loosen your cloak.


@d{}
[Unbuttoning her cloak.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Yes, it is very warm here.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  I am always cold.


@d{}
[Stands looking at her for a time with her arms resting on the
back of the armchair.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Well, Gunhild, it is nearly eight years
now since we saw each other last.


@d{}
[Coldly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Since last we spoke to each other at any rate.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  True, since we spoke to each other.  I daresay you have seen
me now and again--when I came on my yearly visit to the bailiff.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Once or twice, I have.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  I have caught one or two glimpses of you, too--there, at the
window.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  You must have seen me through the curtains then.  You have good
eyes.  
@d{}
[Harshly and cuttingly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
But the last time we spoke to each
other--it was here in this room----


@d{}
[Trying to stop her.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Yes, yes; I know, Gunhild!


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  --the week before he--before he was let out.


@d{}
[Moving towards the back.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
O, don't speak about that.


@d{}
[Firmly, but in a low voice.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
It was the week before he--was
set at liberty.


@d{}
[Coming down.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Oh yes, yes, yes!  I shall never forget that
time!  But it is too terrible to think of!  Only to recall it
for the moment--oh!


@d{}
[Gloomily.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
And yet one's thoughts can never get away from it.

@d{}
[Vehemently; clenching her hands together.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
No, I can't understand
how such a thing--how anything so horrible can come upon one single
family!  And then--that it should be our family!  So old a family
as ours!  Think of its choosing us out!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Oh, Gunhild--there were many, many families besides ours that
that blow fell upon.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Oh yes; but those others don't trouble me very much.  For in
their case it was only a matter of a little money--or some papers.
But for us----!  For me!  And then for Erhart!  My little boy--as
he then was!  
@d{}
[In rising excitement.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
The shame that fell upon
us two innocent ones!  The dishonour!  The hateful, terrible
dishonour!  And then the utter ruin too!


@d{}
[Cautiously.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Tell me, Gunhild, how does he bear it?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Erhart, do you mean?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  No--he himself.  How does he bear it?


@d{}
[Scornfully.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Do you think I ever ask about that?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Ask?  Surely you do not require to ask----


@d{}
[Looks at her in surprise.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
You don't suppose I ever have
anything to do with him?  That I ever meet him?  That I see
anything of him?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Not even that!


@d{}
[As before.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
The man was in gaol, in gaol for five years!

@d{}
[Covers her face with her hands.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Oh, the crushing shame of it!

@d{}
[With increased vehemence.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
And then to think of all that the
name of John Gabriel Borkman used to mean!  No, no, no--I can
never see him again!  Never!


@d{}
[Looks at her for a while.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
You have a hard heart, Gunhild.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Towards him, yes.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  After all, he is your husband.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Did he not say in court that it was I who began his ruin?  That
I spent money so recklessly?


@d{}
[Tentatively.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
But is there not some truth in that?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Why, it was he himself that made me do it!  He insisted on our
living in such an absurdly lavish style----


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes, I know.  But that is just where you should have restrained
him; and apparently you didn't.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  How was I to know that it was not his own money he gave me to
squander?  And that he himself used to squander, too--ten times
more than I did!


@d{}
[Quietly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Well, I daresay his position forced him to do that--
to some extent at any rate.


@d{}
[Scornfully.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Yes, it was always the same story--we were to
"cut a figure."  And he did "cut a figure" to some purpose!  He
used to drive about with a four-in-hand as if he were a king.
And he had people bowing and scraping to him just as to a king.
[With a laugh.]  And they always called him by his Christian
names--all the country over--as if he had been the king himself.
"John Gabriel," "John Gabriel," "John Gabriel."  Every one knew
what a great man "John Gabriel" was!


@d{}
[Warmly and emphatically.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
He was a great man then.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Yes, to all appearance.  But he never breathed a single word to
me as to his real position--never gave a hint as to where he got
his means from.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  No, no; and other people did not dream of it either.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  I don't care about the other people.  But it was his duty to
tell me the truth.  And that he never did!  He kept on lying to
me--lying abominably----


@d{}
[Interrupting.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Surely not, Gunhild.  He kept things back
perhaps, but I am sure he did not lie.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Well, well; call it what you please; it makes no difference.
And then it all fell to pieces--the whole thing.


@d{}
[To herself.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Yes, everything fell to pieces--for him--and
for others.


@d{}
[Drawing herself up menacingly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
But I tell you this, Ella,
I do not give in yet!  I shall redeem myself yet--you may make
up your mind to that!


@d{}
[Eagerly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Redeem yourself!  What do you mean by that?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Redeem my name, and honour, and fortune!  Redeem my ruined life--
that is what I mean!  I have some one in reserve, let me tell you--
one who will wash away every stain that he has left.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Gunhild!  Gunhild!


@d{}
[With rising excitement.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
There is an avenger living, I tell
you!  One who will make up to me for all his father's sins!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Erhart you mean.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Yes, Erhart, my own boy!  He will redeem the family, the house,
the name.  All that can be redeemed.--And perhaps more besides.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  And how do you think that is to be done?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  It must be done as best it can; I don't know how.  But I know
that it must and shall be done.  
@d{}
[Looks searchingly at her.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Come
now, Ella; isn't that really what you have had in mind too, ever
since he was a child?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  No, I can't exactly say that.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  No?  Then why did you take charge of him when the storm broke
upon--upon this house?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  You could not look after him yourself at that time, Gunhild.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  No, no, I could not.  And his father--he had a valid enough
excuse--while he was there--in safe keeping----


@d{}
[Indignant.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Oh, how can you say such things!--You!


@d{}
[With a venomous expression.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
And how could you make up your
mind to take charge of the child of a--a John Gabriel!  Just as
if he had been your own?  To take the child away from me--home
with you--and keep him there year after year, until the boy was
nearly grown up.  
@d{}
[Looking suspiciously at her.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
What was your
real reason, Ella?  Why did you keep him with you?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  I came to love him so dearly----


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  More than I--his mother?


@d{}
[Evasively.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
I don't know about that.  And then, you know,
Erhart was rather delicate as a child----


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Erhart--delicate!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes, I thought so--at that time at any rate.  And you know the
air of the west coast is so much milder than here.


@d{}
[Smiling bitterly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
H'm--is it indeed?  
@d{}
[Breaking off.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Yes,
it is true you have done a great deal for Erhart.  
@d{}
[With a change
of tone.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Well, of course, you could afford it.  
@d{}
[Smiling.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
You
were so lucky, Ella; you managed to save all your money.


@d{}
[Hurt.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
I did not manage anything about it, I assure you.  I
had no idea--until long, long afterwards--that the securities
belonging to me--that they had been left untouched.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Well, well; I don't understand anything about these things!  I
only say you were lucky.  
@d{}
[Looking inquiringly at her.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
But when
you, of your own accord, undertook to educate Erhart for me--what
was your motive in that?


@d{}
[Looking at her.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
My motive?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Yes, some motive you must have had.  What did you want to do
with him?  To make of him, I mean?


@d{}
[Slowly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
I wanted to smooth the way for Erhart to happiness
in life.


@d{}
[Contemptuously.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Pooh--people situated as we are have something
else than happiness to think of.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  What, then?


@d{}
[Looking steadily and earnestly at her.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Erhart has in the first
place to make so brilliant a position for himself, that no trace
shall be left of the shadow his father has cast upon my name--and
my son's.


@d{}
[Searchingly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Tell me, Gunhild, is this what Erhart himself
demands of his life?


@d{}
[Slightly taken aback.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Yes, I should hope so!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Is it not rather what you demand of him?


@d{}
[Curtly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Erhart and I always make the same demands upon
ourselves.


@d{}
[Sadly and slowly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
You are so very certain of your boy, then,
Gunhild?


@d{}
[With veiled triumph.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Yes, that I am--thank Heaven.  You may
be sure of that!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Then I should think in reality you must be happy after all; in
spite of all the rest.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  So I am--so far as that goes.  But then, every moment, all the
rest comes rushing in upon me like a storm.


@d{}
[With a change of tone.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Tell me--you may as well tell me at
once--for that is really what I have come for----


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  What?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Something I felt I must talk to you about.--Tell me--Erhart does
not live out here with--with you others?


@d{}
[Harshly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Erhart cannot live out here with me.  He has to live
in town----


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  So he wrote to me.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  He must, for the sake of his studies.  But he comes out to me
for a little while every evening.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Well, may I see him then?  May I speak to him at once?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  He has not come yet; but I expect him every moment.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Why, Gunhild, surely he must have come.  I can hear his footsteps
overhead.


@d{}
[With a rapid upward glance.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Up in the long gallery?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes.  I have heard him walking up and down there ever since
I came.


@d{}
[Looking away from her.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
That is not Erhart, Ella.


@d{}
[Surprised.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Not Erhart?  
@d{}
[Divining.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Who is it then?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  It is he.


@d{}
[Softly, with suppressed pain.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Borkman?  John Gabriel Borkman?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  He walks up and down like that--backwards and forwards--from
morning to night--day out and day in.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  I have heard something of this----


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  I daresay.  People find plenty to say about us, no doubt.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Erhart has spoken of it in his letters.  He said that his father
generally remained by himself--up there--and you alone down here.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Yes; that is how it has been, Ella, ever since they let him out,
and sent him home to me.  All these long eight years.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  I never believed it could really be so.  It seemed impossible!


@d{}
[Nods.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
It is so; and it can never be otherwise.


@d{}
[Looking at her.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
This must be a terrible life, Gunhild.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Worse than terrible--almost unendurable.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes, it must be.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Always to hear his footsteps up there--from early morning till
far into the night.  And everything sounds so clear in this house!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes, it is strange how clear the sound is.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  I often feel as if I had a sick wolf pacing his cage up there in
the gallery, right over my head.  
@d{}
[Listens and whispers.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Hark!
Do you hear!  Backwards and forwards, up and down, goes the wolf.


@d{}
[Tentatively.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Is no change possible, Gunhild?


@d{}
[With a gesture of repulsion.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
He has never made any movement
towards a change.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Could you not make the first movement, then?


@d{}
[Indignantly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
I!  After all the wrong he has done me!  No thank
you!  Rather let the wolf go on prowling up there.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  This room is too hot for me.  You must let me take off my things
after all.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Yes, I asked you to.

    
@d{}
[ELLA RENTHEIM takes off her hat and cloak and lays them on a
        chair beside the door leading to the hall.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Do you never happen to meet him, away from home?


@d{}
[With a bitter laugh.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
In society, do you mean?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  I mean, when he goes out walking.  In the woods, or----


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  He never goes out.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Not even in the twilight?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Never.


@d{}
[With emotion.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
He cannot bring himself to go out?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  I suppose not.  He has his great cloak and his hat hanging in
the cupboard--the cupboard in the hall, you know----


@d{}
[To herself.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
The cupboard we used to hide in when we were
little.


@d{}
[Nods.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
And now and then--late in the evening--I can hear him
come down as though to go out.  But he always stops when he is
halfway downstairs, and turns back--straight back to the gallery.


@d{}
[Quietly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Do none of his old friends ever come up to see him?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  He has no old friends.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  He had so many--once.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  H'm!  He took the best possible way to get rid of them.  He was
a dear friend to his friends, was John Gabriel.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Oh, yes, that is true, Gunhild.


@d{}
[Vehemently.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
All the same, I call it mean, petty, base,
contemptible of them, to think so much of the paltry losses
they may have suffered through him.  They were only money
losses, nothing more.


@d{}
[Not answering her.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
So he lives up there quite alone.
Absolutely by himself.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Yes, practically so.  They tell me an old clerk or copyist or
something comes out to see him now and then.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Ah, indeed; no doubt it is a man called Foldal.  I know they
were friends as young men.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Yes, I believe they were.  But I know nothing about him.  He
was quite outside our circle--when we had a circle----


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  So he comes out to see Borkman now?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Yes, he condescends to.  But of course he only comes when it
is dark.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  This Foldal--he was one of those that suffered when the bank
failed?


@d{}
[Carelessly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Yes, I believe I heard he had lost some money.
But no doubt it was something quite trifling.


@d{}
[With slight emphasis.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
It was all he possessed.


@d{}
[Smiling.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Oh, well; what he possessed must have been little
enough--nothing to speak of.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  And he did not speak of it--Foldal I mean--during the
investigation.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  At all events, I can assure you Erhart has made ample amends
for any little loss he may have suffered.


@d{}
[With surprise.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Erhart!  How can Erhart have done that?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  He has taken an interest in Foldal's youngest daughter.  He has
taught her things, and put her in the way of getting employment,
and some day providing for herself.  I am sure that is a great
deal more than her father could ever have done for her.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes, I daresay her father can't afford to do much.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  And then Erhart has arranged for her to have lessons in music.
She has made such progress already that she can come up to--to
him in the gallery, and play to him.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  So he is still fond of music?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Oh yes, I suppose he is.  Of course he has the piano you sent
out here--when he was expected back----


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  And she plays to him on it?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Yes, now and then--in the evenings.  That is Erhart's doing, too.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Has the poor girl to come all the long way out here, and then
back to town again?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  No, she doesn't need to.  Erhart has arranged for her to stay
with a lady who lives near us--a Mrs. Wilton----


@d{}
[With interest.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Mrs. Wilton?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  A very rich woman.  You don't know her.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  I have heard her name.  Mrs. Fanny Wilton, is it not----?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Yes, quite right.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Erhart has mentioned her several times.  Does she live out
here now?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Yes, she has taken a villa here; she moved out from town some
time ago.


@d{}
[With a slight hesitation.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
They say she is divorced from
her husband.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Her husband has been dead for several years.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes, but they were divorced.  He got a divorce.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  He deserted her, that is what he did.  I am sure the fault
wasn't hers.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Do you know her at all intimately, Gunhild?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Oh yes, pretty well.  She lives close by here; and she looks in
every now and then.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  And do you like her?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  She is unusually intelligent; remarkably clear in her judgments.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  In her judgments of people, do you mean?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Yes, principally of people.  She has made quite a study of
Erhart; looked deep into his character--into his soul.  And
the result is she idolises him, as she could not help doing.


@d{}
[With a touch of finesse.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Then perhaps she knows Erhart still
better than she knows you?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Yes, Erhart saw a good deal of her in town, before she came
out here.


@d{}
[Without thinking.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
And in spite of that she moved out of town?


@d{}
[Taken aback, looking keenly at her.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
In spite of that!  What
do you mean?


@d{}
[Evasively.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Oh, nothing particular.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  You said it strangely--you did mean something by it, Ella!


@d{}
[Looking her straight in the eyes.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Yes, that is true, Gunhild!
I did mean something by it.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Well, then, say it right out.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  First let me tell you, I think I too have a certain claim upon
Erhart.  Do you think I haven't?


@d{}
[Glancing round the room.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
No doubt--after all the money you
have spent upon him.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Oh, not on that account, Gunhild.  But because I love him.


@d{}
[Smiling scornfully.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Love my son?  Is it possible?  You?  In
spite of everything?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes, it is possible--in spite of everything.  And it is true.
I love Erhart--as much as I can love any one--now--at my time of
life.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Well, well, suppose you do: what then?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Why, then, I am troubled as soon as I see anything threatening
him.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Threatening Erhart!  Why, what should threaten him?  Or who?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  You in the first place--in your way.


@d{}
[Vehemently.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
I!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  And then this Mrs. Wilton, too, I am afraid.


@d{}
[Looks at her for a moment in speechless surprise.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
And you
think such things of Erhart!  Of my own boy!  He, who has his
great mission to fulfil!


@d{}
[Lightly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Oh, his mission!


@d{}
[Indignantly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
How dare you say that so scornfully?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Do you think a young man of Erhart's age, full of health and
spirits--do you think he is going to sacrifice himself for--for
such a thing as a "mission"?


@d{}
[Firmly and emphatically.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Erhart will!  I know he will.


@d{}
[Shaking her head.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
You neither know it nor believe it, Gunhild.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  I don't believe it!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  It is only a dream that you cherish.  For if you hadn't that to
cling to, you feel that you would utterly despair.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Yes, indeed I should despair.  
@d{}
[Vehemently.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
And I daresay that
is what you would like to see, Ella!


@d{}
[With head erect.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Yes, I would rather see that than see you
"redeem" yourself at Erhart's expense.


@d{}
[Threateningly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
You want to come between us?  Between mother
and son?  You?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  I want to free him from your power--your will--your despotism.


@d{}
[Triumphantly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
You are too late!  You had him in your nets
all these years--until he was fifteen.  But now I have won him
again, you see!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Then I will win him back from you!  
@d{}
[Hoarsely, half whispering.]

@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
We two have fought a life-and-death battle before, Gunhild--for a
man's soul!


@d{}
[Looking at her in triumph.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Yes, and I won the victory.


@d{}
[With a smile of scorn.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Do you still think that victory was
worth the winning?


@d{}
[Darkly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
No; Heaven knows you are right there.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  You need look for no victory worth the winning this time either.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Not when I am fighting to preserve a mother's power over my son!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  No; for it is only power over him that you want.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  And you?


@d{}
[Warmly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
I want his affection--his soul--his whole heart!


@d{}
[With an outburst.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
That you shall never have in this world!


@d{}
[Looking at her.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
You have seen to that?


@d{}
[Smiling.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Yes, I have taken that liberty.  Could you not see
that in his letters?


@d{}
[Nods slowly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Yes.  I could see you--the whole of you--in his
letters of late.


@d{}
[Gallingly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
I have made the best use of these eight years.  I
have had him under my own eye, you see.


@d{}
[Controlling herself.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
What have you said to Erhart about me?
Is it the sort of thing you can tell me?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Oh yes, I can tell you well enough.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Then please do.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  I have only told him the truth.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Well?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  I have impressed upon him, every day of his life, that he must
never forget that it is you we have to thank for being able to
live as we do--for being able to live at all.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Is that all?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Oh, that is the sort of thing that rankles; I feel that in my
own heart.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  But that is very much what Erhart knew already.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  When he came home to me, he imagined that you did it all out
of goodness of heart.  [Looks malignly at her.]  Now he does not
believe that any longer, Ella.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Then what does he believe now?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  He believes what is the truth.  I asked him how he accounted
for the fact that Aunt Ella never came here to visit us----


@d{}
[Interrupting.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
He knew my reasons already!


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  He knows them better now.  You had got him to believe that it
was to spare me and--and him up there in gallery----


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  And so it was.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Erhart does not believe that for a moment, now.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  What have you put in his head?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  He thinks, what is the truth, that you are ashamed of us--that
you despise us.  And do you pretend that you don't?  Were you not
once planning to take him quite away from me?  Think, Ella; you
cannot have forgotten.


@d{}
[With a gesture of negation.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
That was at the height of the
scandal--when the case was before the courts.  I have no such
designs now.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  And it would not matter if you had.  For in that case what would
become of his mission?  No, thank you.  It is me that Erhart needs--
not you.  And therefore he is as good as dead to you--and you to
him.


@d{}
[Coldly, with resolution.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
We shall see.  For now I shall remain
out here.


@d{}
[Stares at her.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Here?  In this house?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes, here.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Here--with us?  Remain all night?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  I shall remain here all the rest of my days if need be.


@d{}
[Collecting herself.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Very well, Ella; the house is yours----


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Oh, nonsense----


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Everything is yours.  The chair I am sitting in is yours.  The
bed I lie and toss in at night belongs to you.  The food we eat
comes to us from you.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  It can't be arranged otherwise, you know.  Borkman can hold no
property of his own; for some one would at once come and take it
from him.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Yes, I know.  We must be content to live upon your pity and
charity.


@d{}
[Coldly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
I cannot prevent you from looking at it in that
light, Gunhild.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  No, you cannot.  When do you want us to move out?


@d{}
[Looking at her.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Move out?


@d{}
[In great excitement.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Yes; you don't imagine that I will go
on living under the same roof with you!  I tell you, I would
rather go to the workhouse or tramp the roads!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Good.  Then let me take Erhart with me----


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Erhart?  My own son?  My child?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes; for then I would go straight home again.


@d{}
[After reflecting a moment, firmly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Erhart himself shall choose
between us.


@d{}
[Looking doubtfully and hesitatingly at her.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
He choose?  Dare
you risk that, Gunhild?


@d{}
[With a hard laugh.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Dare I?  Let my boy choose between his
mother and you?  Yes, indeed I dare!


@d{}
[Listening.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Is there some one coming?  I thought I heard----


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Then it must be Erhart.

    
@d{}
[There is a sharp knock at the door leading in from the hall,
        which is immediately opened.  MRS. WILTON enters, in
        evening dress, and with outer wraps.  She is followed by
        THE MAID, who has not had time to announce her, and looks
        bewildered.  The door remains half open.  MRS. WILTON is
        a strikingly handsome, well-developed woman in the

[ERHART BORKMAN flings the half-open door wide open and rushes
        in.  He is a young man with bright cheerful eyes.  He is

What does this mean, Erhart?  Were you hiding out in

Erhart--Mr. Borkman came in with me.

@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Indeed, Erhart!  You don't come to your
mother first?

for little Frida.

Well, Mrs. Wilton, if you will give
us the pleasure of your company this evening, won't you----


@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}

  Many thanks, my dear lady, but I really can't.  We have another
invitation.  We're going down to the Hinkels'.

@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
We?  Whom do you mean by we?


@d{}
[Laughing.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}
Oh, I ought really to have said I.  But I was
commissioned by the ladies of the house to bring Mr. Borkman
with me--if I happened to see him.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  And you did happen to see him, it appears.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}

  Yes, fortunately.  He was good enough to look in at my house--
to call for Frida.


@d{}

But, Erhart, I did not know that you knew that family--
those Hinkels?

No, I don't exactly know them.  
@d{}

impatiently.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
You know better than anybody, mother, what people
I know and don't know.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}

  Oh, it doesn't matter!  They soon put you at your ease in that
house!  They are such cheerful, hospitable people--the house swarms
with young ladies.


@d{}
[With emphasis.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
If I know my son rightly, Mrs. Wilton, they
are no fit company for him.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}

  Why, good gracious, dear lady, he is young, too, you know!

  Yes, fortunately he's young.  He would need to be young.


@d{}

@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Well, well, well, mother, it's
quite clear I can't got to the Hinkels' this evening.  Of course
I shall remain here with you and Aunt Ella.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  I knew you would, my dear Erhart.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  No, Erhart, you must not stop at home on my account----

  Yes, indeed, my dear Aunt; I can't think of going.  
@d{}

doubtfully at Mrs. Wilton]

out of it?  You have said "Yes" for me, haven't you?


@d{}
[Gaily.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}
What nonsense!  Not get out of it!  When I make my
entrance into the festive halls--just imagine it!--deserted and
forlorn--then I must simply say "No" for you.


@d{}
[Hesitatingly.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Well, if you really think I can get out of
it----


@d{}
[Putting the matter lightly aside.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}
I am quite used to saying
both yes and no--on my own account.  And you can't possibly think
of leaving your aunt the moment she has arrived!  For shame,
Monsieur Erhart!  Would that be behaving like a good son?


@d{}

@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Son?

  Yes, you may well add that.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}

  Oh, it seems to me we have often more cause to be grateful to
a foster-mother than to our own mother.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Has that been your experience?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}

  I knew very little of my own mother, I am sorry to say.  But if
I had had a good foster-mother, perhaps I shouldn't have been so--
so naughty, as people say I am.  
@d{}
[Turning towards Erhart Borkman]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}
Well,
then we stop peaceably at home like a good boy, and drink tea
with mamma and auntie!  
@d{}
[To the ladies.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}
Good-bye, good-bye Mrs.
Borkman!  Good-bye Miss Rentheim.

    
@d{}
[The ladies bow silently.  She goes toward the door.


@d{}
[Following her.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Shan't I go a little bit of the way with you?


@d{}
[In the doorway, motioning him back.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}
You shan't go a step
with me.  I am quite accustomed to taking my walks alone.  
@d{}
[Stops
on the threshold, looks at him and nods.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}
But now beware, Mr.
Borkman--I warn you!


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  What am I to beware of?


@d{}
[Gaily.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}
Why, as I go down the road--deserted and forlorn, as
I said before--I shall try if I can't cast a spell upon you.


@d{}
[Laughing.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Oh, indeed!  Are you going to try that again?


@d{}
[Half seriously.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}
Yes, just you beware!  As I go down the road,
I will say in my own mind--right from the very centre of my will--
I will say: "Mr. Erhart Borkman, take your hat at once!"


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  And you think he will take it?


@d{}
[Laughing.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}
Good heavens, yes, he'll snatch up his hat
instantly.  And then I will say: "Now put on your overcoat, like
a good boy, Erhart Borkman!  And your goloshes!  Be sure you don't
forget the goloshes!  And then follow me!  Do as I bid you, as I
bid you, as I bid you!"


@d{}
[With forced gaiety.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Oh, you may rely on that.


@d{}
[Raising her forefinger.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}
As I bid you!  As I bid you!
Good-night!

    
@d{}
[She laughs and nods to the ladies, and closes the door
        behind her.


@x{"names":["Mrs. Wilton"]}

@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Does she really play tricks of that sort?


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  Oh, not at all.  How can you think so!  She only says it in fun.

@d{}
[Breaking off.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
But don't let us talk about Mrs. Wilton.  
@d{}
[He
forces ELLA RENTHEIM to seat herself at the armchair beside the
stove, then stands and looks at her.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
To think of your having
taken all this long journey, Aunt Ella!  And in winter too!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  I found I had to, Erhart.


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  Indeed?  Why so?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  I had to come to town after all, to consult the doctors.


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  Oh, I'm glad of that!


@d{}
[Smiling.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Are you glad of that?


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  I mean I am glad you made up your mind to it at last.


@d{}
[On the sofa, coldly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Are you ill, Ella?


@d{}
[Looking hardly at her.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
You know quite well that I am ill.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  I knew you were not strong, and hadn't been for years.


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  I told you before I left you that you ought to consult a doctor.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  There is no one in my neighbourhood that I have any real
confidence in.  And, besides, I did not feel it so much at
that time.


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  Are you worse, then, Aunt?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes, my dear boy; I am worse now.


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  But there's nothing dangerous?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Oh, that depends how you look at it.


@d{}
[Emphatically.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Well, then, I tell you what it is, Aunt Ella;
you mustn't think of going home again for the present.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  No, I am not thinking of it.


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  You must remain in town; for here you can have your choice of
all the best doctors.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  That was what I thought when I left home.


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  And then you must be sure and find a really nice place to live--
quiet, comfortable rooms.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  I went this morning to the old ones, where I used to stay before.


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  Oh, well, you were comfortable enough there.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes, but I shall not be staying there after all.


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  Indeed?  Why not?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  I changed my mind after coming out here.


@d{}
[Surprised.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Really?  Changed you mind?


@d{}
[Crocheting; without looking up.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Your aunt will live here, in
her own house, Erhart.


@d{}
[Looking from one to the other alternately.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Here, with us?  Is
this true, Aunt?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes, that is what I made up my mind to do.


@d{}
[As before.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Everything here belongs to your aunt, you know.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  I intend to remain here, Erhart--just now--for the present.
I shall set up a little establishment of my own, over in the
bailiff's wing.


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  Ah, that's a good idea.  There are plenty of rooms there.  
@d{}
[With
sudden vivacity.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
But, by-the-bye, Aunt--aren't you very tired
after your journey?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Oh yes, rather tired.


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  Well, then, I think you ought to go quite early to bed.


@d{}
[Looks at him smilingly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
I mean to.


@d{}
[Eagerly.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
And then we could have a good long talk to-morrow--
or some other day, of course--about this and that--about things
in general--you and mother and I.  Wouldn't that be much the
best plan, Aunt Ella?


@d{}
[With an outburst, rising from the sofa.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Erhart, I can see you
are going to leave me!


@d{}
[Starts.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
What do you mean by that?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  You are going down to--to the Hinkels'?


@d{}
[Involuntarily.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Oh, that!  
@d{}
[Collecting himself.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Well, you
wouldn't have me sit here and keep Aunt Ella up half the night?
Remember, she's an invalid, mother.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  You are going to the Hinkels', Erhart!


@d{}
[Impatiently.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Well, really, mother, I don't think I can well
get out of it.  What do you say, Aunt?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  I should like you to feel quite free, Erhart.


@d{}
[Goes up to her menacingly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
You want to take him away from me!


@d{}
[Rising.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Yes, if only I could, Gunhild!
    
@d{}
[Music is heard from above.


@d{}
[Writhing as if in pain.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Oh, I can't endure this!  
@d{}
[Looking
round.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
What have I done with my hat?  
@d{}
[To Ella Rentheim]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Do
you know the air that she is playing up there?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  No.  What is it?


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  It's the _Danse Macabre_--the Dance of Death!  Don't you know
the Dance of Death, Aunt?


@d{}
[Smiling sadly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Not yet, Erhart.


@d{}
[To Mrs. Borkman]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Mother--I beg and implore you--let me go!


@d{}
[Looks hardly at him.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Away from your mother?  So that is what
you want to do?


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  Of course I'll come out again--to-morrow perhaps.


@d{}
[With passionate emotion.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
You want to go away from me!  To be
with those strange people!  With--with--no, I will not even think
of it!


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  There are bright lights down there, and young, happy faces; and
there's music there, mother!


@d{}
[Pointing upwards.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
There is music here, too, Erhart.


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  Yes, it's just that music that drives me out of the house.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Do you grudge your father a moment of self-forgetfulness?


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  No, I don't.  I'm very, very glad that he should have it--if
only _I_ don't have to listen.


@d{}
[Looking solemnly at him.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Be strong, Erhart!  Be strong, my
son!  Do not forget that you have your great mission.


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  Oh, mother--do spare me these phrases!  I wasn't born to be
a "missionary."--Good-night, aunt dear!  Good-night, mother.
    
@d{}
[He goes hastily out through the hall.


@x{"names":["Erhart Borkman"]}

@d{}
[After a short silence.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
It has not taken you long to recapture
him, Ella, after all.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  I wish I could believe it.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  But you shall see you won't be allowed to keep him long.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Allowed?  By you, do you mean?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  By me or--by her, the other one----


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Then rather she than you.


@d{}
[Nodding slowly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
That I understand.  I say the same.  Rather
she than you.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Whatever should become of him in the end----


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  It wouldn't greatly matter, I should say.


@d{}
[Taking her outdoor things upon her arm.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
For the first time in
our lives, we twin sisters are of one mind.  Good-night, Gunhild.

    
@d{}
[She goes out by the hall.  The music sounds louder from above.


@x{"names":["Ella Rentheim"]}

@d{}
[Stands still for a moment, starts, shrinks together, and
whispers involuntarily.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
The wolf is whining again--the sick wolf.

@d{}
[She stands still for a moment, then flings herself down on the
floor, writhing in agony and whispering:]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Erhart! Erhart!--be
true to me!  Oh, come home and help your mother!  For I can bear
this life no longer!

ACT SECOND


The great gallery on the first floor of the Rentheim House.
    The walls are covered with old tapestries, representing
    hunting-scenes, shepherds and shepherdesses, all in faded
    colours.  A folding-door to the left, and further forward a
    piano.  In the left-hand corner, at the back, a door, cut in
    the tapestry, and covered with tapestry, without any frame.
    Against the middle of the right wall, a large writing-table of
    carved oak, with many books and papers.  Further forward on
    the same side, a sofa with a table and chairs in front of it.
    The furniture is all of a stiff Empire style.  Lighted lamps
    on both tables.

JOHN GABRIEL BORKMAN stands with his hands behind his back, beside
    the piano, listening to FRIDA FOLDAL, who is playing the last
    bars of the "Danse Macabre."

BORKMAN is of middle height, a well-knit, powerfully-built man,
    well on in the sixties.  His appearance is distinguished,
    his profile finely cut, his eyes piercing, his hair and
    beard curly and greyish-white.  He is dressed in a slightly
    old-fashioned black coat, and wears a white necktie.  FRIDA
    FOLDAL is a pretty, pale girl of fifteen, with a somewhat
    weary and overstrained expression.  She is cheaply dressed in
    light colours.



@e{"names":["John Gabriel Borkman","Frida Foldal"]}

@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Can you guess where I first heard tones like these?


@d{}
[Looking up at him.]  
@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}
No, Mr. Borkman.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  It was down in the mines.


@d{}
[Not understanding.]  
@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}
Indeed?  Down in the mines?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  I am a miner's son, you know.  Or perhaps you did not know?


@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}

  No, Mr. Borkman.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  A miner's son.  And my father used sometimes to take me with
him into the mines.  The metal sings down there.


@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}

  Really?  Sings?


@d{}
[Nodding.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
When it is loosened.  The hammer-strokes that loosen
it are the midnight bell clanging to set it free; and that is why
the metal sings--in its own way--for gladness.


@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}

  Why does it do that, Mr. Borkman?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  It wants to come up into the light of day and serve mankind.
     
@d{}
[He paces up and down the gallery, always with his hands
        behind his back.


@d{}
[Sits waiting a little, then looks at her watch and rises.]

@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}
I beg your pardon, Mr. Borkman; but I am afraid I must go.


@d{}
[Stopping before her.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Are you going already?


@d{}
[Putting her music in its case.]  
@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}
I really must.  
@d{}
[Visibly
embarrassed.]  
@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}
I have an engagement this evening.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  For a party?


@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}

  Yes.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  And you are to play before the company?


@d{}
[Biting her lip.]  
@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}
No; at least I am only to play for dancing.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Only for dancing?


@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}

  Yes; there is to be a dance after supper.


@d{}
[Stands and looks at her.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Do you like playing dance music?
At parties, I mean?


@d{}
[Putting on her outdoor things.]  
@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}
Yes, when I can get an
engagement.  I can always earn a little in that way.


@d{}
[With interest.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Is that the principal thing in your mind as
you sit playing for the dancers?


@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}

  No; I'm generally thinking how hard it is that I mayn't join
in the dance myself.


@d{}
[Nodding.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
That is just what I wanted to know.  
@d{}
[Moving
restlessly about the room.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Yes, yes, yes.  That you must not
join in the dance, that is the hardest thing of all.  
@d{}
[Stopping.]

@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
But there is one thing that should make up to you for that, Frida.


@d{}
[Looking inquiringly at him.]  
@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}
What is that, Mr. Borkman?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  The knowledge that you have ten times more music in you than
all the dancers together.


@d{}
[Smiling evasively.]  
@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}
Oh, that's not at all so certain.


@d{}
[Holding up his fore-finger warningly.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
You must never be so
mad as to have doubts of yourself!


@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}

  But since no one knows it----


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  So long as you know it yourself, that is enough.  Where is it
you are going to play this evening?


@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}

  Over at the Hinkel's.


@d{}
[With a swift, keen glance at her.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Hinkel's, you say!


@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}

  Yes.


@d{}
[With a cutting smile.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Does that man give parties?  Can he
get people to visit him?


@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}

  Yes, they have a great many people about them, Mrs. Wilton says.


@d{}
[Vehemently.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
But what sort of people?  Can you tell me that?


@d{}
[A little nervously.]  
@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}
No, I really don't know.  Yes, by-the-bye,
I know that young Mr. Borkman is to be there this evening.


@d{}
[Taken aback.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Erhart?  My son?


@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}

  Yes, he is going there.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  How do you know that?


@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}

  He said so himself--an hour ago.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Is he out here to-day?


@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}

  Yes, he has been at Mrs. Wilton's all the afternoon.


@d{}
[Inquiringly.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Do you know if he called here too?  I mean, did
he see any one downstairs?


@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}

  Yes, he looked in to see Mrs. Borkman.


@d{}
[Bitterly.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Aha--I might have known it.


@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}

  There was a strange lady calling upon her, I think.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Indeed?  Was there?  Oh yes, I suppose people do come now and
then to see Mrs. Borkman.


@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}

  If I meet young Mr. Borkman this evening, shall I ask him to
come up and see you too?


@d{}
[Harshly.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
You shall do nothing of the sort!  I won't have it
on any account.  The people who want to see me can come of their
own accord.


@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}

  Oh, very well; I shan't say anything then.  Good-night, Mr.
Borkman.


@d{}
[Pacing up and down and growling.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Good-night.


@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}

  Do you mind if I run down by the winding stair?  It's the
shortest way.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Oh, by all means; take whatever stair you please, so far as I
am concerned.  Good-night to you!


@l{"name":"Frida Foldal"}

  Good-night, Mr. Borkman.

    
@d{}
[She goes out by the little tapestry door in the back on
        the left.

    [BORKMAN, lost in thought, goes up to the piano, and is about
        to close it, but changes his mind.  Looks round the great
        empty room, and sets to pacing up and down it from the
        corner at the back on the right--pacing backward and
        forward uneasily and incessantly.  At last he goes up
        to the writing-table, listens in the direction of the
        folding door, hastily snatches up a hand-glass, looks
        at himself in it, and straightens his necktie.

    [A knock at the folding door.  BORKMAN hears it, looks rapidly
        towards the door, but says nothing.

    [In a little there comes another knock, this time louder.

upon it, and his right thrust in the breast of his coat.]

in!

    
@d{}
[VILHELM FOLDAL comes softly into the room.  He is a bent
        and worn man with mild blue eyes and long, thin grey hair
        straggling down over his coat collar.  He has a portfolio
        under his arm, a soft felt hat, and large horn spectacles,
        which he pushes up over his forehead.

disappointed, half pleased expression.]

  Good evening, John Gabriel.  Yes, you see it is me.

@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
I must say you are rather a late visitor.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Well, you know, it's a good bit of a way, especially when you
have to trudge it on foot.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  But why do you always walk, Vilhelm?  The tramway passes your
door.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  It's better for you to walk--and then you always save twopence.
Well, has Frida been playing to you lately?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  She has just this moment gone.  Did you not meet her outside?


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  No, I have seen nothing of her for a long time; not since she
went to live with this Mrs. Wilton.


@d{}
[Seating himself on the sofa and waving his hand toward a chair.]

@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
You may sit down, Vilhelm.



@d{}
[Seating himself on the edge of a chair.]    

@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
Many thanks.


@d{}
[Looks mournfully at him.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
You can't think how lonely I feel since Frida
left home.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Oh, come--you have plenty left.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Yes, God knows I have--five of them.  But Frida was the only one
who at all understood me.  
@d{}
[Shaking his head sadly.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
The others
don't understand me a bit.


@d{}
[Gloomily, gazing straight before him, and drumming on the
table with his fingers.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
No, that's just it.  That is the curse
we exceptional, chosen people have to bear.  The common herd--
the average man and woman--they do not understand us, Vilhelm.


@d{}
[With resignation.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
If it were only the lack of understanding--
with a little patience, one could manage to wait for that awhile
yet.  
@d{}
[His voice choked with tears.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
But there is something
still bitterer.


@d{}
[Vehemently.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
There is nothing bitterer than that.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Yes, there is, John Gabriel.  I have gone through a domestic
scene to-night--just before I started.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Indeed?  What about?


@d{}
[With an outburst.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
My people at home--they despise me.


@d{}
[Indignantly.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Despise----?


@d{}
[Wiping his eyes.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
I have long known it; but to-day it came
out unmistakably.


@d{}
[After a short silence.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
You made an unwise choice, I fear,
when you married.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  I had practically no choice in the matter.  And, you see, one
feels a need for companionship as one begins to get on in years.
And so crushed as I then was--so utterly broken down----


@d{}
[Jumping up in anger.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Is this meant for me?  A reproach----!


@d{}
[Alarmed.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
No, no, for Heaven's sake, John Gabriel----!


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Yes, you are thinking of the disaster to the bank, I can see
you are.


@d{}
[Soothingly.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
But I don't blame you for that!  Heaven forbid!


@d{}
[Growling, resumes his seat.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Well, that is a good thing, at
any rate.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Besides, you mustn't think it is my wife that I complain of.  It
is true she has not much polish, poor thing; but she is a good sort
of woman all the same.  No, it's the children.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  I thought as much.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  For the children--well, they have more culture and therefore
they expect more of life.


@d{}
[Looking at him sympathetically.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
And so your children despise
you, Vilhelm?


@d{}
[Shrugging his shoulders.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
I haven't made much of a career,
you see--there is no denying that.


@d{}
[Moving nearer to him, and laying his hand upon his arm.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Do
they not know, then, that in your young days you wrote a tragedy?


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Yes, of course they know that.  But it doesn't seem to make much
impression on them.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Then they don't understand these things.  For your tragedy is
good.  I am firmly convinced of that.


@d{}
[Brightening up.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
Yes, don't you think there are some good
things in it, John Gabriel?  Good God, if I could only manage
to get it placed----!  
@d{}
[Opens his portfolio, and begins eagerly
turning over the contents.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
Look here!  Just let me show you
one or two alterations I have made.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Have you it with you?


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Yes, I thought I would bring it.  It's so long now since I have
read it to you.  And I thought perhaps it might amuse you to hear
an act or two.


@d{}
[Rising, with a negative gesture.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
No, no, we will keep that
for another time.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Well, well, as you please.

    
@d{}
[BORKMAN paces up and down the room.  FOLDAL puts the
        manuscript up again.


@d{}
[Stopping in front of him.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
You are quite right in what you
said just now--you have not made any career.  But I promise you
this, Vilhelm, that when once the hour of my restoration strikes----


@d{}
[Making a movement to rise.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
Oh, thanks, thanks!


@d{}
[Waving his hand.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
No, please be seated.  
@d{}
[With rising
excitement.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
When the hour of my restoration strikes--when they
see that they cannot get on without me--when they come to me, here
in the gallery, and crawl to my feet, and beseech me to take the
reins of the bank again----!  The new bank, that they have founded
and can't carry on----  
@d{}
[Placing himself beside the writing-table
in the same attitude as before, and striking his breast.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Here
I shall stand, and receive them!  And it shall be known far and
wide, all the country over, what conditions John Gabriel Borkman
imposes before he will----  
@d{}
[Stopping suddenly and staring at
Vilhelm Foldal]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
You're looking so doubtfully at me!  Perhaps you do not
believe that they will come?  That they must, must, must come to
me some day?  Do you not believe it?


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Yes, Heaven knows I do, John Gabriel.


@d{}
[Seating himself again on the sofa.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
I firmly believe it.  I
am immovably convinced--I know that they will come.  If I had not
been certain of that I would have put a bullet through my head
long ago.


@d{}
[Anxiously.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
Oh no, for Heaven's sake----!


@d{}
[Exultantly.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
But they will come!  They will come sure enough!
You shall see!  I expect them any day, any moment.  And you see,
I hold myself in readiness to receive them.


@d{}
[With a sigh.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
If only they would come quickly.


@d{}
[Restlessly.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Yes, time flies: the years slip away; life----
Ah, no--I dare not think of it!  
@d{}
[Looking at him.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Do you know
what I sometimes feel like?


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  What?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  I feel like a Napoleon who has been maimed in his first battle.


@d{}
[Placing his hand upon his portfolio.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
I have that feeling too.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Oh, well, that is on a smaller scale, of course.


@d{}
[Quietly.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
My little world of poetry is very precious to me,
John Gabriel.


@d{}
[Vehemently.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Yes, but think of me, who could have created
millions!  All the mines I should have controlled!  New veins
innumerable!  And the water-falls!  And the quarries!  And the
trade routes, and the steamship-lines all the wide world over!
I would have organised it all--I alone!


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Yes, I know, I know.  There was nothing in the world you would
have shrunk from.


@d{}
[Clenching his hands together.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
And now I have to sit here,
like a wounded eagle, and look on while others pass me in the
race, and take everything away from me, piece by piece!


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  That is my fate too.


@d{}
[Not noticing him.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Only to think of it; so near to the goal
as I was!  If I had only had another week to look about me!  All
the deposits would have been covered.  All the securities I had
dealt with so daringly should have been in their places again as
before.  Vast companies were within a hair's-breadth of being
floated.  Not a soul should have lost a half-penny.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Yes, yes; you were on the very verge of success.


@d{}
[With suppressed fury.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
And then treachery overtook me!  Just
at the critical moment!  
@d{}
[Looking at him.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Do you know what I
hold to be the most infamous crime a man can be guilty of?


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  No, tell me.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  It is not murder.  It is not robbery or house-breaking.  It is
not even perjury.  For all these things people do to those they
hate, or who are indifferent to them, and do not matter.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  What is the worst of all then, John Gabriel?


@d{}
[With emphasis.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
The most infamous of crimes is a friend's
betrayal of his friend's confidence.


@d{}
[Somewhat doubtfully.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
Yes, but you know----


@d{}
[Firing up.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
What are you going to say?  I see it in your face.
But it is of no use.  The people who had their securities in the
bank should have got them all back again--every farthing.  No; I
tell you the most infamous crime a man can commit is to misuse a
friend's letters; to publish to all the world what has been
confided to him alone, in the closest secrecy, like a whisper
in an empty, dark, double-locked room.  The man who can do such
things is infected and poisoned in every fibre with the morals
of the higher rascality.  And such a friend was mine--and it
was he who crushed me.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  I can guess whom you mean.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  There was not a nook or cranny of my life that I hesitated
to lay open to him.  And then, when the moment came, he turned
against me the weapons I myself had placed in his hands.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  I have never been able to understand why he----  Of course,
there were whispers of all sorts at the time.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  What were the whispers?  Tell me.  You see I know nothing.
For I had to go straight into--into isolation.  What did people
whisper, Vilhelm?


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  You were to have gone into the Cabinet, they said.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  I was offered a portfolio, but I refused it.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Then it wasn't there you stood in his way?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Oh, no; that was not the reason he betrayed me.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Then I really can't understand----


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  I may as well tell you, Vilhelm----


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Well?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  There was--in fact, there was a woman in the case.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  A woman in the case?  Well but, John Gabriel----


@d{}
[Interrupting.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Well, well--let us say no more of these stupid
old stories.  After all, neither of us got into the Cabinet,
neither he nor I.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  But he rose high in the world.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  And I fell into the abyss.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Oh, it's a terrible tragedy----


@d{}
[Nodding to him.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Almost as terrible as yours, I fancy, when
I come to think of it.


@d{}
[Naively.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
Yes, at least as terrible.


@d{}
[Laughing quietly.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
But looked at from another point of view,
it is really a sort of comedy as well.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  A comedy?  The story of your life?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Yes, it seems to be taking a turn in that direction.  For let
me tell you----


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  What?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  You say you did not meet Frida as you came in?


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  No.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  At this moment, as we sit here, she is playing waltzes for the
guests of the man who betrayed and ruined me.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  I hadn't the least idea of that.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Yes, she took her music, and went straight from me to--to the
great house.


@d{}
[Apologetically.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
Well, you see, poor child----


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  And can you guess for whom she is playing--among the rest?


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  No.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  For my son.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  What?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  What do you think of that, Vilhelm?  My son is down there in
the whirl of the dance this evening.  Am I not right in calling
it a comedy?


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  But in that case you may be sure he knows nothing about it.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  What does he know?


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  You may be sure he doesn't know how he--that man----


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Do not shrink from his name.  I can quite well bear it now.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  I'm certain your son doesn't know the circumstances, John Gabriel.


@d{}
[Gloomily, sitting and beating the table.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Yes, he knows, as
surely as I am sitting here.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Then how can he possibly be a guest in that house?


@d{}
[Shaking his head.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
My son probably does not see things with
my eyes.  I'll take my oath he is on my enemies' side!  No doubt
he thinks, as they do, that Hinkel only did his confounded duty
when he went and betrayed me.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  But, my dear friend, who can have got him to see things in
that light?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Who?  Do you forget who has brought him up?  First his aunt,
from the time he was six or seven years old; and now, of late
years, his mother!


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  I believe you are doing them an injustice.


@d{}
[Firing up.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
I never do any one injustice!  Both of them have
gone and poisoned his mind against me, I tell you!


@d{}
[Soothingly.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
Well, well, well, I suppose they have.


@d{}
[Indignantly.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Oh these women!  They wreck and ruin life for
us!  Play the devil with our whole destiny--our triumphal progress.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Not all of them!


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Indeed?  Can you tell me of a single one that is good for
anything?


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  No, that is the trouble.  The few that I know are good for
nothing.


@d{}
[With a snort of scorn.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Well then, what is the good of it?
What is the good of such women existing--if you never know them?


@d{}
[Warmly.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
Yes, John Gabriel, there is good in it, I assure you.
It is such a blessed, beneficial thought that here or there in the
world, somewhere, far away--the true woman exists after all.


@d{}
[Moving impatiently on the sofa.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Oh, do spare me that poetical
nonsense.


@d{}
[Looks at him, deeply wounded.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
Do you call my holiest faith
poetical nonsense?


@d{}
[Harshly.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Yes I do!  That is what has always prevented you
from getting on in the world.  If you would get all that out of
your head, I could still help you on in life--help you to rise.


@d{}
[Boiling inwardly.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
Oh, you can't do that.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  I can when once I come into power again.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  That won't be for many a day.


@d{}
[Vehemently.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Perhaps you think that day will never come?
Answer me!


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  I don't know what to answer.


@d{}
[Rising, cold and dignified, and waving his hand towards the
door.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Then I no longer have any use for you.


@d{}
[Starting up.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
No use----!


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Since you do not believe that the tide will turn for me----


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  How can I believe in the teeth of all reason?  You would have
to be legally rehabilitated----


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Go on! go on!


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  It's true I never passed my examination; but I have read enough
law to know that----


@d{}
[Quickly.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
It is impossible, you mean?


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  There is no precedent for such a thing.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Exceptional men are above precedents.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  The law knows nothing of such distinctions.


@d{}
[Harshly and decisively.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
You are no poet, Vilhelm.


@d{}
[Unconsciously folding his hands.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
Do you say that in sober
earnest?


@d{}
[Dismissing the subject, without answering.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
We are only
wasting each other's time.  You had better not come here again.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Then you really want me to leave you?


@d{}
[Without looking at him.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
I have no longer any use for you.


@d{}
[Softly, taking his portfolio.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
No, no, no; I daresay not.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Here you have been lying to me all the time.


@d{}
[Shaking his head.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
Never lying, John Gabriel.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Have you not sat here feeding me with hope, and trust, and
confidence--that was all a lie?


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  It wasn't a lie so long as you believed in my vocation.  So long
as you believed in me, I believed in you.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Then we have been all the time deceiving each other.  And perhaps
deceiving ourselves--both of us.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  But isn't that just the essence of friendship, John Gabriel?


@d{}
[Smiling bitterly.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Yes, you are right there.  Friendship
means--deception.  I have learnt that once before.


@d{}
[Looking at him.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
I have no poetic vocation!  And you could
actually say it to me so bluntly.


@d{}
[In a gentler tone.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Well, you know, I don't pretend to know
much about these matters.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Perhaps you know more than you think.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  I?


@d{}
[Softly.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
Yes, you.  For I myself have had my doubts, now and
then, I may tell you.  The horrible doubt that I may have bungled
my life for the sake of a delusion.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  If you have no faith in yourself, you are on the downward path
indeed.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  That was why I found such comfort in coming here to lean upon
your faith in me.  
@d{}
[Taking his hat.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
But now you have become a
stranger to me.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  And you to me.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Good night, John Gabriel.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Good night, Vilhelm.
    
@d{}
[Foldal goes out to the left.

    [BORKMAN stands for a moment gazing at the closed door; makes
        a movement as though to call FOLDAL back, but changes his
        mind, and begins to pace the floor with his hands behind
        his back.  Then he stops at the table beside the sofa and
        puts out the lamp.  The room becomes half dark.  After a
        short pause, there comes a knock at the tapestry door.


@x{"names":["Vilhelm Foldal"]}

@d{}
[At the table, starts, turns, and asks in a loud voice:]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Who is
that knocking?
    
@d{}
[No answer, another knock.


@d{}
[Without moving.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Who is it?  Come in!

    
@d{}
[ELLA RENTHEIM, with a lighted candle in her hand, appears in
        the doorway.  She wears her black dress, as before, with
        her cloak thrown loosely round her shoulders.


@e{"names":["Ella Rentheim"]}

@d{}
[Staring at her.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Who are you?  What do you want with me?


@d{}
[Closes the door and advances.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
It is I, Borkman.

     
@d{}
[She puts down the candle on the piano and remains standing
         beside it.


@d{}
[Stands as though thunderstruck, stares fixedly at her, and says
in a half-whisper.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Is it--is it Ella?  Is it Ella Rentheim?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes, it's "your" Ella, as you used to call me in the old days;
many, many years ago.


@d{}
[As before.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Yes, it is you Ella, I can see you now.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Can you recognise me?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Yes, now I begin to----


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  The years have told on me, and brought winter with them, Borkman.
Do you not think so?


@d{}
[In a forced voice.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
You are a good deal changed--just at first
glance.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  There are no dark curls on my neck now--the curls you once loved
to twist round your fingers.


@d{}
[Quickly.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
True!  I can see now, Ella, you have done your hair
differently.


@d{}
[With a sad smile.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Precisely; it is the way I do my hair that
makes the difference.


@d{}
[Changing the subject.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
I had no idea that you were in this
part of the world.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  I have only just arrived.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Why have you come all this way now, in winter?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  That you shall hear.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Is it me you have come to see?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  You among others.  But if I am to tell you my errand, I must
begin far back.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  You look tired.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes, I am tired.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Won't you sit down?  There on the sofa.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes, thank you; I need rest.

    
@d{}
[She crosses to the right and seats herself in the furthest
        forward corner of the sofa.  BORKMAN stands beside the
        table with his hands behind his back looking at her.  A
        short silence.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  It seems an endless time since we two met, Borkman, face to face.


@d{}
[Gloomily.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
It is a long, long time.  And terrible things have
passed since then.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  A whole lifetime has passed--a wasted lifetime.


@d{}
[Looking keenly at her.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Wasted!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes, I say wasted--for both of us.


@d{}
[In a cold business tone.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
I cannot regard my life as wasted
yet.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  And what about mine?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  There you have yourself to blame, Ella.


@d{}
[With a start.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
And you can say that?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  You could quite well have been happy without me.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Do you believe that?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  If you had made up your mind to.


@d{}
[Bitterly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Oh, yes, I know well enough there was some one else
ready to marry me.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  But you rejected him.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes, I did.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Time after time you rejected him.  Year after year----


@d{}
[Scornfully.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Year after year I rejected happiness, I suppose
you think?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  You might perfectly well have been happy with him.  And then I
should have been saved.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  You?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Yes, you would have saved me, Ella.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  How do you mean?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  He thought I was at the bottom of your obstinacy--of your
perpetual refusals.  And then he took his revenge.  It was so easy
for him; he had all my frank, confiding letters in his keeping.  He
made his own use of them; and then it was all over with me--for
the time, that is to say.  So you see it is all your doing, Ella!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Oh indeed, Borkman.  If we look into the matter, it appears that
it is I who owe you reparation.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  It depends how you look at it.  I know quite well all that you
have done for us.  You bought in this house, and the whole
property, at the auction.  You placed the house entirely at my
disposal--and your sister too.  You took charge of Erhart, and
cared for him in every way----


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  As long as I was allowed to----


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  By your sister, you mean.  I have never mixed myself up in these
domestic affairs.  As I was saying, I know all the sacrifices you
have made for me and for your sister.  But you were in a position
to do so, Ella; and you must not forget that it was I who placed
you in that position.


@d{}
[Indignantly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
There you make a great mistake, Borkman!  It was
the love of my inmost heart for Erhart--and for you too--that made
me do it!


@d{}
[Interrupting.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
My dear Ella, do not let us get upon questions
of sentiment and that sort of thing.  I mean, of course, that if
you acted generously, it was I that put it in your power to do so.


@d{}
[Smiling.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
H'm!  In my power----


@d{}
[Warmly.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Yes, put it in your power, I say!  On the eve of the
great decisive battle--when I could not afford to spare either kith
or kin--when I had to grasp at--when I did grasp at the millions
that were entrusted to me--then I spared all that was yours, every
farthing, although I could have taken it, and made use of it, as
I did of all the rest!


@d{}
[Coldly and quietly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
That is quite true, Borkman.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Yes it is.  And that was why, when they came and took me, they
found all your securities untouched in the strong-room of the bank.


@d{}
[Looking at him.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
I have often and often wondered what was your
real reason for sparing all my property?  That, and that alone.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  My reason?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes, your reason.  Tell me.


@d{}
[Harshly and scornfully.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Perhaps you think it was that I might
have something to fall back upon, if things went wrong?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Oh no, I am sure you did not think of that in those days.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Never!  I was so absolutely certain of victory.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Well then, why was it that----?


@d{}
[Shrugging his shoulders.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Upon my soul, Ella, it is not so
easy to remember one's motives of twenty years ago.  I only know
that when I used to grapple, silently and alone, with all the
great projects I had in my mind, I had something like the feeling
of a man who is starting on a balloon voyage.  All through my
sleepless nights I was inflating my giant balloon, and preparing
to soar away into perilous, unknown regions.


@d{}
[Smiling.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
You, who never had the least doubt of victory?


@d{}
[Impatiently.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Men are made so, Ella.  They both doubt and
believe at the same time.  
@d{}
[Looking straight before him.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
And
I suppose that was why I would not take you and yours with me
in the balloon.


@d{}
[Eagerly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Why, I ask you?  Tell me why!


@d{}
[Without looking at her.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
One shrinks from risking what one
holds dearest on such a voyage.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  You had risked what was dearest to you on that voyage.  Your
whole future life----


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Life is not always what one holds dearest.


@d{}
[Breathlessly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Was that how you felt at that time?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  I fancy it was.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  I was the dearest thing in the world to you?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  I seem to remember something of the sort.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  And yet years had passed since you had deserted me--and married--
married another!


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Deserted you, you say?  You must know very well that it was
higher motives--well then, other motives that compelled me.
Without his support I could not have done anything.


@d{}
[Controlling herself.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
So you deserted me from--higher motives.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  I could not get on without his help.  And he made you the price
of helping me.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  And you paid the price.  Paid it in full--without haggling.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  I had no choice.  I had to conquer or fall.


@d{}
[In a trembling voice, looking at him.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Can what you tell me
be true--that I was then the dearest thing in the world to you?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Both then and afterwards--long, long, after.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  But you bartered me away none the less; drove a bargain with
another man for your love.  Sold my love for a--for a directorship.


@d{}
[Gloomily and bowed down.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
I was driven by inexorable
necessity, Ella.


@d{}
[Rises from the sofa, quivering with passion.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Criminal!


@d{}
[Starts, but controls himself.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
I have heard that word before.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Oh, don't imagine I'm thinking of anything you may have done
against the law of the land!  The use you made of all those
vouchers and securities, or whatever you call them--do you think
I care a straw about that!  If I could have stood at your side
when the crash came----


@d{}
[Eagerly.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
What then, Ella?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Trust me, I should have borne it all so gladly along with you.
The shame, the ruin--I would have helped you to bear it all--all!


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Would you have had the will--the strength?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Both the will and the strength.  For then I did not know of
your great, your terrible crime.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  What crime?  What are you speaking of?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  I am speaking of that crime for which there is no forgiveness.


@d{}
[Staring at her.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
You must be out of your mind.


@d{}
[Approaching him.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
You are a murderer!  You have committed the
one mortal sin!


@d{}
[Falling back towards the piano.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
You are raving, Ella!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  You have killed the love-life in me.  
@d{}
[Still nearer him.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Do
you understand what that means?  The Bible speaks of a mysterious
sin for which there is no forgiveness.  I have never understood
what it could be; but now I understand.  The great, unpardonable
sin is to murder the love-life in a human soul.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  And you say I have done that?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  You have done that.  I have never rightly understood until
this evening what had really happened to me.  That you deserted
me and turned to Gunhild instead--I took that to be mere common
fickleness on your part, and the result of heartless scheming
on hers.  I almost think I despised you a little, in spite of
everything.  But now I see it!  You deserted the woman you loved!
Me, me, me!  What you held dearest in the world you were ready to
barter away for gain.  That is the double murder you have
committed!  The murder of your own soul and of mine!


@d{}
[With cold self-control.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
How well I recognise your passionate,
ungovernable spirit, Ella.  No doubt it is natural enough that
you should look at the thing in this light.  Of course, you are
a woman, and therefore it would seem that your own heart is the
one thing you know or care about in this world.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes, yes it is.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Your own heart is the only thing that exists for you.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  The only thing!  The only thing!  You are right there.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  But you must remember that I am a man.  As a woman, you were the
dearest thing in the world to me.  But if the worst comes to the
worst, one woman can always take the place of another.


@d{}
[Looks at him with a smile.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Was that your experience when you
had made Gunhild your wife?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  No.  But the great aims I had in life helped me to bear even
that.  I wanted to have at my command all the sources of power
in this country.  All the wealth that lay hidden in the soil,
and the rocks, and the forests, and the sea--  I wanted to gather
it all into my hands to make myself master of it all, and so to
promote the well-being of many, many thousands.


@d{}
[Lost in recollection.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
I know it.  Think of all the evenings
we spent in talking over your projects.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Yes, I could talk to you, Ella.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  I jested with your plans, and asked whether you wanted to awaken
all the sleeping spirits of the mine.


@d{}
[Nodding.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
I remember that phrase.  
@d{}
[Slowly.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
All the sleeping
spirits of the mine.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  But you did not take it as a jest.  You said: "Yes, yes, Ella,
that is just what I want to do."


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  And so it was.  If only I could get my foot in the stirrup----
And that depended on that one man.  He could and would secure me
the control of the bank--if I on my side----


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes, just so!  If you on your side would renounce the woman you
loved--and who loved you beyond words in return.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  I knew his consuming passion for you.  I knew that on no other
condition would he----


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  And so you struck the bargain.


@d{}
[Vehemently.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Yes, I did, Ella!  For the love of power is
uncontrollable in me, you see!  So I struck the bargain; I had to.
And he helped me half-way up towards the beckoning heights that I
was bent on reaching.  And I mounted and mounted; year by year
I mounted----


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  And I was as though wiped out of your life.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  And after all he hurled me into the abyss again.  On account of
you, Ella.


@d{}
[After a short thoughtful silence.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Borkman, does it not seem
to you as if there had been a sort of curse on our whole relation?


@d{}
[Looking at her.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
A curse?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes.  Don't you think so?


@d{}
[Uneasily.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Yes. But why is it?  
@d{}
[With an outburst.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Oh Ella,
I begin to wonder which is in the right--you or I!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  It is you who have sinned.  You have done to death all the
gladness of my life in me.


@d{}
[Anxiously.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Do not say that, Ella!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  All a woman's gladness at any rate.  From the day when your image
began to dwindle in my mind, I have lived my life as though under
an eclipse.  During all these years it has grown harder and harder
for me--and at last utterly impossible--to love any living creature.
Human beings, animals, plants: I shrank from all--from all but one----


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  What one?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Erhart, of course.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Erhart?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Erhart--your son, Borkman.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Has he really been so close to your heart?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Why else should I have taken him to me, and kept him as long as
ever I could?  Why?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  I thought it was out of pity, like all the rest that you did.


@d{}
[In strong inward emotion.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Pity!  Ha, ha!  I have never known
pity, since you deserted me.  I was incapable of feeling it.  If
a poor starved child came into my kitchen, shivering, and crying,
and begging for a morsel of food, I let the servants look to it.
I never felt any desire to take the child to myself, to warm it
at my own hearth, to have the pleasure of seeing it eat and be
satisfied.  And yet I was not like that when I was young; that I
remember clearly!  It is you that have created an empty, barren
desert within me--and without me too!


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Except only for Erhart.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes, except for your son.  But I am hardened to every other
living thing.  You have cheated me of a mother's joy and happiness
in life--and of a mother's sorrows and tears as well.  And perhaps
that is the heaviest part of the loss to me.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Do you say that, Ella?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Who knows?  It may be that a mother's sorrows and tears were
what I needed most.  
@d{}
[With still deeper emotion.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
But at that
time I could not resign myself to my loss; and that was why I
took Erhart to me.  I won him entirely.  Won his whole, warm,
trustful childish heart--until----  Oh!


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Until what?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Until his mother--his mother in the flesh, I mean--took him from
me again.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  He had to leave you in any case; he had to come to town.


@d{}
[Wringing her hands.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Yes, but I cannot bear the solitude--
the emptiness!  I cannot bear the loss of your son's heart!


@d{}
[With an evil expression in his eyes.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
H'm--I doubt whether
you have lost it, Ella.  Hearts are not so easily lost to a
certain person--in the room below.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  I have lost Erhart here, and she has won him back again.  Or
if not she, some one else.  That is plain enough in the letters
he writes me from time to time.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Then it is to take him back with you that you have come here?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes, if only it were possible----!


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  It is possible enough, if you have set your heart upon it.  For
you have the first and strongest claims upon him.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Oh, claims, claims!  What is the use of claims?  If he is not
mine of his own free will, he is not mine at all.  And have him
I must!  I must have my boy's heart, whole and undivided--now!


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  You must remember that Erhart is well into his twenties.  You
could scarcely reckon on keeping his heart very long undivided,
as you express it.


@d{}
[With a melancholy smile.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
It would not need to be for so very
long.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Indeed?  I should have thought that when you want a thing, you
want it to the end of your days.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  So I do.  But that need not mean for very long.


@d{}
[Taken aback.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
What do you mean by that?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  I suppose you know I have been in bad health for many years past?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Have you?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Do you not know that?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  No, I cannot say I did----


@d{}
[Looking at him in surprise.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Has Erhart not told you so?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  I really don't remember at the moment.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Perhaps he has not spoken of me at all?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Oh, yes, I believe he has spoken of you.  But the fact is, I
so seldom see anything of him--scarcely ever.  There is a certain
person below that keeps him away from me.  Keeps him away, you
understand?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Are you quite sure of that, Borkman?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Yes, absolutely sure.  
@d{}
[Changing his tone.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
And so you have
been in bad health, Ella?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes, I have.  And this autumn I grew so much worse that I had
to come to town and take better medical advice.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  And you have seen the doctors already?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes, this morning.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  And what did they say to you?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  They gave me full assurance of what I had long suspected.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Well?


@d{}
[Calmly and quietly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
My illness will never be cured, Borkman.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Oh, you must not believe that, Ella.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  It is a disease that there is no help or cure for.  The doctors
can do nothing with it.  They must just let it take its course.
They cannot possibly check it; at most, they can allay the
suffering.  And that is always something.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Oh, but it will take a long time to run its course.  I am sure
it will.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  I may perhaps last out the winter, they told me.


@d{}
[Without thinking.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Oh, well, the winter is long.


@d{}
[Quietly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Long enough for me, at any rate.


@d{}
[Eagerly, changing the subject.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
But what in all the world can
have brought on this illness?  You, who have always lived such a
healthy and regular life?  What can have brought it on?


@d{}
[Looking at him.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
The doctors thought that perhaps at one time
in my life I had had to go through some great stress of emotion.


@d{}
[Firing up.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Emotion!  Aha, I understand!  You mean that it is
my fault?


@d{}
[With increasing inward agitation.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
It is too late to go into
that matter now!  But I must have my heart's own child again before
I go!  It is so unspeakably sad for me to think that I must go
away from all that is called life--away from sun, and light, and
air--and not leave behind me one single human being who will think
of me--who will remember me lovingly and mournfully--as a son
remembers and thinks of the mother he has lost.


@d{}
[After a short pause.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Take him, Ella, if you can win him.


@d{}
[With animation.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Do you give your consent?  Can you?


@d{}
[Gloomily.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Yes.  And it is no great sacrifice either.  For in
any case he is not mine.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Thank you, thank you all the same for the sacrifice!  But I have
one thing more to beg of you--a great thing for me, Borkman.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Well, what is it?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  I daresay you will think it childish of me--you will not
understand----


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Go on--tell me what it is.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  When I die--as I must soon--I shall have a fair amount to leave
behind me.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Yes, I suppose so.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  And I intend to leave it all to Erhart.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Well, you have really no one nearer to you than he.


@d{}
[Warmly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
No, indeed, I have no one nearer me than he.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  No one of your own family.  You are the last.


@d{}
[Nodding slowly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Yes, that is just it.  When I die, the name
of Rentheim dies with me.  And that is such a torturing thought
to me.  To be wiped out of existence--even to your very name----


@d{}
[Firing up.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Ah, I see what you are driving at!


@d{}
[Passionately.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Do not let this be my forte.  Let Erhart bear
my name after me!


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  I understand you well enough.  You want to save my son from
having to bear his father's name.  That is your meaning.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  No, no, not that!  I myself would have borne it proudly and
gladly along with you!  But a mother who is at the point of
death----  There is more binding force in a name than you think
or believe, Borkman.


@d{}
[Coldly and proudly.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Well and good, Ella.  I am man enough
to bear my own name alone.


@d{}
[Seizing and pressing his hand.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Thank you, thank you!  Now
there has been a full settlement between us!  Yes, yes, let it
be so!  You have made all the atonement in your power.  For when
I have gone from the world, I shall leave Erhart Rentheim behind
me!

    
@d{}
[The tapestry door is thrown open.  MRS. BORKMAN, with the
        large shawl over her head, stands in the doorway.

@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Never to his dying day shall Erhart
be called by that name!

[Shrinking back.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
I allow no one to come up to my
room!


@d{}
[Advancing a step.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
I do not ask your permission.


@d{}
[Going towards her.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
What do you want with me?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  I will fight with all my might for you.  I will protect you
from the powers of evil.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  The worst "powers of evil" are in yourself, Gunhild!


@d{}
[Harshly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
So be it then.  
@d{}
[Menacingly, with upstretched arm.]

@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
But this I tell you--he shall bear his father's name!  And bear
it aloft in honour again!  My son's heart shall be mine--mine
and no other's.

    
@d{}
[She goes out by the tapestry door and shuts it behind her.


@x{"names":["Mrs. Borkman"]}

@d{}
[Shaken and shattered.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Borkman, Erhart's life will be wrecked
in this storm.  There must be an understanding between you and
Gunhild.  We must go down to her at once.


@d{}
[Looking at her.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
We?  I too, do you mean?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Both you and I.


@d{}
[Shaking his head.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
She is hard, I tell you.  Hard as the metal
I once dreamed of hewing out of the rocks.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Then try it now!

ACT THIRD


    MRS. BORKMAN's drawing room.  The lamp is still burning on
        the table beside the sofa in front.  The garden-room at
        the back is quite dark.

    MRS. BORKMAN, with the shawl still over her head, enters, in
        violent agitation, by the hall door, goes up to the window,
        draws the curtain a little aside, and looks out; then she
        seats herself beside the stove, but immediately springs
        up again, goes to the bell-pull and rings.  Stands beside
        the sofa, and waits a moment.  No one comes.  Then she
        rings again, this time more violently.

    THE MAID presently enters from the hall.  She looks sleepy
        and out of temper, and appears to have dressed in great
        haste.



@e{"names":["Mrs. Borkman","The Maid"]}

@d{}
[Impatiently.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
What has become of you, Malena?  I have rung
for you twice!


@l{"name":"The Maid"}

  Yes, ma'am, I heard you.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  And yet you didn't come?



@d{}
[Sulkily.]  
@l{"name":"The Maid"}
I had to put some clothes on first, I suppose.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Yes, you must dress yourself properly, and then you must run and
fetch my son.


@d{}
[Looking at her in astonishment.]  
@l{"name":"The Maid"}
You want me to fetch Mr.
Erhart?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Yes; tell him he must come home to me at once; I want to speak
to him.


@d{}
[Grumbling.]  
@l{"name":"The Maid"}
Then I'd better go to the bailiff's and call up
the coachman.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Why?


@l{"name":"The Maid"}

  To get him to harness the sledge.  The snow's dreadful to-night.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Oh, that doesn't matter; only make haste and go.  It's just round
the corner.


@l{"name":"The Maid"}

  Why, ma'am you can't call that just round the corner!


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Of course it is.  Don't you know Mr. Hinkel's villa?


@d{}
[With malice.]  
@l{"name":"The Maid"}
Oh, indeed!  It's there Mr. Erhart is this
evening?


@d{}
[Taken aback.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Why, where else should he be?


@d{}
[With a slight smile.]  
@l{"name":"The Maid"}
Well, I only thought he might be where
he usually is.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Where do you mean?


@l{"name":"The Maid"}

  At Mrs. Wilton's, as they call her.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Mrs. Wilton's?  My son isn't so often there.


@d{}
[Half muttering.]  
@l{"name":"The Maid"}
I've heard say as he's there every day of
his life.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  That's all nonsense, Malena.  Go straight to Mr. Hinkel's and
try to to get hold of him.


@d{}
[With a toss of her head.]  
@l{"name":"The Maid"}
Oh, very well; I'm going.

    
@d{}
[She is on the point of going out by the hall, but just at
        that moment the hall door is opened, and ELLA RENTHEIM
        and BORKMAN appear on the threshold.


@e{"names":["John Gabriel Borkman","Ella Rentheim"]}

@d{}
[Staggers a step backwards.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

@l{"name":"The Maid"}
Lord save us!


@d{}
[Whispers to The Maid]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Tell him he must come this instant.


@d{}
[Softly.]  
@l{"name":"The Maid"}
Yes, ma'am.

    
@d{}
[ELLA RENTHEIM and, after her, BORKMAN enter the room.  THE
        MAID sidles behind them to the door, goes out, and closes
        it after her.


@x{"names":["The Maid"]}

@d{}
[Having recovered her self-control, turns to ELLA.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
What does
he want down here in my room?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  He wants to come to an understanding with you, Gunhild.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  He has never tried that before.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  He is going to, this evening.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  The last time we stood face to face--it was in the Court, when
I was summoned to give an account----


@d{}
[Approaching.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
And this evening it is _I_ who will give an
account of myself.


@d{}
[Looking at him.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
You?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Not of what I have done amiss.  All the world knows that.


@d{}
[With a bitter sigh.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Yes, that is true; all the world knows
that.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  But it does not know why I did it; why I had to do it.  People
do not understand that I had to, because I was myself--because I
was John Gabriel Borkman--myself, and not another.  And that is
what I will try to explain to you.


@d{}
[Shaking her head.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
It is of no use.  Temptations and promptings
acquit no one.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  They may acquit one in one's own eyes.


@d{}
[With a gesture of repulsion.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Oh, let all that alone!  I have
thought over that black business of yours enough and to spare.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  I too.  During those five endless years in my cell--and elsewhere
--I had time to think it over.  And during the eight years up there
in the gallery I have had still more ample time.  I have re-tried
the whole case--by myself.  Time after time I have re-tried it.  I
have been my own accuser, my own defender, and my own judge.  I
have been more impartial than any one else could be--that I venture
to say.  I have paced up and down the gallery there, turning every
one of my actions upside down and inside out.  I have examined them
from all sides as unsparingly, as pitilessly, as any lawyer of them
all.  And the final judgment I have always come to is this: the one
person I have sinned against is--myself.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  And what about me?  What about your son?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  You and he are included in what I mean when I say myself.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  And what about the hundreds of others, then--the people you are
said to have ruined?


@d{}
[More vehemently.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
I had power in my hands!  And then I felt
the irresistible vocation within me!  The prisoned millions lay
all over the country, deep in the bowels of the earth, calling
aloud to me!  They shrieked to me to free them!  But no one else
heard their cry--I alone had ears for it.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Yes, to the branding of the name of Borkman.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  If the others had had the power, do you think they would not
have acted exactly as I did?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  No one, no one but you would have done it!


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Perhaps not.  But that would have been because they had not my
brains.  And if they had done it, it would not have been with my
aims in view.  The act would have been a different act.  In short,
I have acquitted myself.


@d{}
[Softly and appealingly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Oh, can you say that so confidently,
Borkman?


@d{}
[Nodding.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Acquitted myself on that score.  But then comes the
great, crushing self-accusation.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  What is that?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  I have skulked up there and wasted eight precious years of my
life!  The very day I was set free, I should have gone forth into
the world--out into the steel-hard, dreamless world of reality!
I should have begun at the bottom and swung myself up to the
heights anew--higher than ever before--in spite of all that
lay between.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Oh, it would have been the same thing over again; take my word
for that.


@d{}
[Shakes his head, and looks at her with a sententious air.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
It
is true that nothing new happens; but what has happened does not
repeat itself either.  It is the eye that transforms the action.
The eye, born anew, transforms the old action.  
@d{}
[Breaking off.]

@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
But you do not understand this.


@d{}
[Curtly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
No, I do not understand it.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Ah, that is just the curse--I have never found one single soul
to understand me.


@d{}
[Looking at him.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Never, Borkman?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Except one--perhaps.  Long, long ago.  In the days when I did
not think I needed understanding.  Since then, at any rate, no
one has understood me!  There has been no one alive enough to
my needs to be afoot and rouse me--to ring the morning bell for
me--to call me up to manful work anew.  And to impress upon me
that I had done nothing inexpiable.


@d{}
[With a scornful laugh.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
So, after all, you require to have
that impressed on you from without?


@d{}
[With increasing indignation.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Yes, when the whole world hisses
in chorus that I have sunk never to rise again, there come moments
when I almost believe it myself.  
@d{}
[Raising his head.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
But then my
inmost assurance rises again triumphant; and that acquits me.


@d{}
[Looking harshly at him.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Why have you never come and asked me
for what you call understanding?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  What use would it have been to come to you?


@d{}
[With a gesture of repulsion.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
You have never loved anything
outside yourself; that is the secret of the whole matter.


@d{}
[Proudly.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
I have loved power.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Yes, power!


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  The power to create human happiness in wide, wide circles around
me!


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  You had once the power to make me happy.  Have you used it to
that end?


@d{}
[Without looking at her.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Some one must generally go down in
a shipwreck.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  And your own son!  Have you used your power--have you lived and
laboured--to make him happy?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  I do not know him.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  No, that is true.  You do not even know him.


@d{}
[Harshly.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
You, his mother, have taken care of that!


@d{}
[Looking at him with a lofty air.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Oh, you do not know what I
have taken care of!


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  You?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Yes, I.  I alone.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Then tell me.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  I have taken care of your memory.


@d{}
[With a short dry laugh.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
My memory?  Oh, indeed!  It sounds
almost as if I were dead already.


@d{}
[With emphasis.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
And so you are.


@d{}
[Slowly.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Yes, perhaps you are right.  [Firing up.]  But no,
no!  Not yet!  I have been close to the verge of death.  But now
I have awakened.  I have come to myself.  A whole life lies before
me yet.  I can see it awaiting me, radiant and quickening.  And
you--you shall see it too.


@d{}
[Raising her hand.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Never dream of life again!  Lie quiet where
you are.


@d{}
[Shocked.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Gunhild!  Gunhild, how can you----!


@d{}
[Not listening to her.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
I will raise the monument over your
grave.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  The pillar of shame, I suppose you mean?


@d{}
[With increasing excitement.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Oh, no, it shall be no pillar
of metal or stone.  And no one shall be suffered to carve any
scornful legend on the monument I shall raise.  There shall be,
as it were, a quickset hedge of trees and bushes, close, close
around your tomb.  They shall hide away all the darkness that
has been.  The eyes of men and the thoughts of men shall no
longer dwell on John Gabriel Borkman!


@d{}
[Hoarsely and cuttingly.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
And this labour of love you will
perform?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Not by my own strength.  I cannot think of that.  But I have
brought up one to help me, who shall live for this alone.  His
life shall be so pure and high and bright, that your burrowing
in the dark shall be as though it had never been!


@d{}
[Darkly and threateningly.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
If it is Erhart you mean, say so
at once!


@d{}
[Looking him straight in the eyes.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Yes, it is Erhart; my son;
he whom you are ready to renounce in atonement for your own acts.


@d{}
[With a look towards ELLA.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
In atonement for my blackest sin.


@d{}
[Repelling the idea.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
A sin towards a stranger only.  Remember
the sin towards me!  
@d{}
[Looking triumphantly at them both.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
But he
will not obey you!  When I cry out to him in my need, he will come
to me!  It is with me that he will remain!  With me, and never
with any one else.  
@d{}
[Suddenly listens, and cries.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
I hear him!
He is here, he is here!  Erhart!

    
@d{}
[ERHART BORKMAN hastily tears open the hall door, and enters
        the room.  He is wearing an overcoat and has his hat on.


@e{"names":["Erhart Borkman"]}

@d{}
[Pale and anxious.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Mother!  What in Heaven's name----!  
@d{}
[Seeing
BORKMAN, who is standing beside the doorway leading into the
garden-room, he starts and takes off his hat.  After a moment's
silence, he asks:]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
What do you want with me, mother?  What has
happened?


@d{}
[Stretching her arms towards him.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
I want to see you, Erhart!
I want to have you with me, always!


@d{}
[Stammering.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Have me----?  Always?  What do you mean by that?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  I will have you, I say!  There is some one who wants to take
you away from me!


@d{}
[Recoiling a step.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Ah--so you know?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Yes.  Do you know it, too?


@d{}
[Surprised, looking at her.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Do _I_ know it?  Yes, of course.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Aha, so you have planned it all out!  Behind my back!  Erhart!
Erhart!


@d{}
[Quickly.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Mother, tell me what it is you know!


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  I know everything.  I know that your aunt has come here to take
you from me.


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  Aunt Ella!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Oh, listen to me a moment, Erhart!


@d{}
[Continuing.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
She wants me to give you up to her.  She wants
to stand in your mother's place to you, Erhart!  She wants you
to be her son, and not mine, from this time forward.  She wants
you to inherit everything from her; to renounce your own name
and take hers instead!


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  Aunt Ella, is this true?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes, it is true.


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  I knew nothing of this.  Why do you want to have me with you
again?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Because I feel that I am losing you here.


@d{}
[Hardly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
You are losing him to me--yes.  And that is just as
it should be.


@d{}
[Looking beseechingly at him.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Erhart, I cannot afford to lose
you.  For, I must tell you I am a lonely--dying woman.


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  Dying----?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes, dying.  Will you came and be with me to the end?  Attach
yourself wholly to me?  Be to me, as though you were my own
child----?


@d{}
[Interrupting.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
And forsake your mother, and perhaps your
mission in life as well?  Will you, Erhart?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  I am condemned to death.  Answer me, Erhart.


@d{}
[Warmly, with emotion.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Aunt Ella, you have been unspeakably
good to me.  With you I grew up in as perfect happiness as any
boy can ever have known----


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Erhart, Erhart!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Oh, how glad I am that you can still say that!


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  But I cannot sacrifice myself to you now.  It is not possible
for me to devote myself wholly to taking a son's place towards you.


@d{}
[Triumphing.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Ah, I knew it!  You shall not have him!  You shall
not have him, Ella!


@d{}
[Sadly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
I see it.  You have won him back.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Yes, yes!  Mine he is, and mine he shall remain!  Erhart, say
it is so, dear; we two have still a long way to go together, have
we not?


@d{}
[Struggling with himself.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Mother, I may as well tell you
plainly----


@d{}
[Eagerly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
What?


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  I am afraid it is only a very little way you and I can go
together.


@d{}
[Stands as though thunderstruck.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
What do you mean by that?


@d{}
[Plucking up spirit.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Good heavens, mother, I am young, after
all!  I feel as if the close air of this room must stifle me in
the end.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Close air?  Here--with me?


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  Yes, here with you, mother.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Then come with me, Erhart.


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  Oh, Aunt Ella, it's not a whit better with you.  It's different,
but no better--no better for me.  It smells of rose-leaves and
lavender there too; it is as airless there as here.


@d{}
[Shaken, but having recovered her composure with an effort.]

@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Airless in your mother's room, you say!


@d{}
[In growing impatience.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Yes, I don't know how else to express
it.  All this morbid watchfulness and--and idolisation, or whatever
you like to call it----  I can't endure it any longer!


@d{}
[Looking at him with deep solemnity.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Have you forgotten what
you have consecrated your life to, Erhart?


@d{}
[With an outburst.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Oh, say rather what you have consecrated
my life to.  You, you have been my will.  You have never given
me leave to have any of my own.  But now I cannot bear this yoke
any longer.  I am young; remember that, mother.  
@d{}
[With a polite,
considerate glance towards John Gabriel Borkman]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
I cannot consecrate my life
to making atonement for another--whoever that other may be.


@d{}
[Seized with growing anxiety.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Who is it that has transformed
you, Erhart?


@d{}
[Struck.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Who?  Can you not conceive that it is I myself?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  No, no, no!  You have come under some strange power.  You
are not in your mother's power any longer; nor in your--your
foster-mother's either.


@d{}
[With laboured defiance.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
I am in my own power, mother!  And
working my own will!


@d{}
[Advancing towards Erhart Borkman]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Then perhaps my hour has come at
last.


@d{}
[Distantly and with measured politeness.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
How so!  How do you
mean, sir?


@d{}
[Scornfully.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Yes, you may well ask that.


@d{}
[Continuing undisturbed.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Listen, Erhart--will you not cast in
your lot with your father?  It is not through any other man's life
that a man who has fallen can be raised up again.  These are only
empty fables that have been told to you down here in the airless
room.  If you were to set yourself to live your life like all the
saints together, it would be of no use whatever to me.


@d{}
[With measured respectfulness.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
That is very true indeed.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Yes, it is.  And it would be of no use either if I should resign
myself to wither away in abject penitence.  I have tried to feed
myself upon hopes and dreams, all through these years.  But I am
not the man to be content with that; and now I mean to have done
with dreaming.


@d{}
[With a slight bow.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
And what will--what will you do, sir?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  I will work out my own redemption, that is what I will do.  I
will begin at the bottom again.  It is only through his present
and his future that a man can atone for his past.  Through work,
indefatigable work, for all that, in my youth, seemed to give life
its meaning--and that now seems a thousand times greater than it
did then.  Erhart, will you join with me and help me in this new
life?


@d{}
[Raising her hand warningly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Do not do it, Erhart!


@d{}
[Warmly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Yes, yes do it!  Oh, help him, Erhart!


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  And you advise him to do that?  You, the lonely dying woman.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  I don't care about myself.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  No, so long as it is not I that take him from you.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Precisely so, Gunhild.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Will you, Erhart?


@d{}
[Wrung with pain.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Father, I cannot now.  It is utterly
impossible!


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  What do you want to do then?


@d{}
[With a sudden glow.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
I am young!  I want to live, for once
in a way, as well as other people!  I want to live my own life!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  You cannot give up two or three little months to brighten the
close of a poor waning life?


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  I cannot, Aunt, however much I may wish to.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Not for the sake of one who loves you so dearly?


@d{}
[Looking sharply at him.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
And your mother has no power over
you either, any more?


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  I will always love you, mother; but I cannot go on living for
you alone.  This is no life for me.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Then come and join with me, after all!  For life, life means
work, Erhart.  Come, we two will go forth into life and work
together!


@d{}
[Passionately.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Yes, but I don't want to work now!  For I am
young!  That's what I never realised before; but now the knowledge
is tingling through every vein in my body.  I will not work!  I
will only live, live, live!


@d{}
[With a cry of divination.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Erhart, what will you live for?


@d{}
[With sparkling eyes.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
For happiness, mother!


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  And where do you think you can find that?


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  I have found it, already!


@d{}
[Shrieks.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Erhart!  
@d{}
[ERHART goes quickly to the hall door and
throws it open.]


@d{}
[Calls out.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Fanny, you can come in now!

    
@d{}
[MRS. WILTON, in outdoor wraps, appears on the threshold.


@e{"names":["Mrs. Wilton"]}

@d{}
[With uplifted hands.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Mrs. Wilton!


@d{}
[Hesitating a little, with an enquiring glance at Erhart Borkman]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}
Do you
want me to----?


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  Yes, now you can come in.  I have told them everything.

    
@d{}
[MRS. WILTON comes forward into the room.  ERHART closes the
        door behind her.  She bows formally to BORKMAN, who returns
        her bow in silence.  A short pause.


@d{}
[In a subdued but firm voice.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}
So the word has been spoken--
and I suppose you all think I have brought a great calamity upon
this house?


@d{}
[Slowly, looking hard at her.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
You have crushed the last
remnant of interest in life for me.  
@d{}
[With an outburst.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
But
all of this--all this is utterly impossible!


@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}

  I can quite understand that it must appear impossible to you,
Mrs. Borkman.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Yes, you can surely see for yourself that it is impossible.
Or what----?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}

  I should rather say that it seems highly improbable.  But it's
so, none the less.


@d{}
[Turning.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Are you really in earnest about this, Erhart?


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  This means happiness for me, mother--all the beauty and
happiness of life.  That is all I can say to you.


@d{}
[Clenching her hands together; to Mrs. Wilton]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Oh, how you
have cajoled and deluded my unhappy son!


@d{}
[Raising her head proudly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}
I have done nothing of the sort.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  You have not, say you!


@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}

  No.  I have neither cajoled nor deluded him.  Erhart came to me
of his own free will.  And of my own free will I went out half-way
to meet him.


@d{}
[Measuring her scornfully with her eye.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Yes, indeed!  That I
can easily believe.


@d{}
[With self-control.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}
Mrs. Borkman, there are forces in human
life that you seem to know very little about.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  What forces, may I ask?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}

  The forces which ordain that two people shall join their lives
together, indissolubly--and fearlessly.


@d{}
[With a smile.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
I thought you were already indissolubly bound--
to another.


@d{}
[Shortly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}
That other has deserted me.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  But he is still living, they say.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}

  He is dead to me.


@d{}
[Insistently.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Yes, mother, he is dead to Fanny.  And besides,
this other makes no difference to me!


@d{}
[Looking sternly at him.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
So you know all this--about the other.


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  Yes, mother, I know quite well--all about it!


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  And yet you can say that it makes no difference to you?


@d{}
[With defiant petulance.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
I can only tell you that it is
happiness I must have!  I am young!  I want to live, live, live!


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Yes, you are young, Erhart.  Too young for this.


@d{}
[Firmly and earnestly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}
You must not think, Mrs. Borkman,
that I haven't said the same to him.  I have laid my whole life
before him.  Again and again I have reminded him that I am seven
years older than he----


@d{}
[Interrupting.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Oh, nonsense, Fanny--I knew that all the time.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}

  But nothing--nothing was of any use.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Indeed?  Nothing?  Then why did you not dismiss him without
more ado?  Close your door to him?  You should have done that,
and done it in time!


@d{}
[Looks at her, and says in a low voice.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}
I could not do that,
Mrs. Borkman.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Why could you not?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}

  Because for me too this meant happiness.


@d{}
[Scornfully.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
H'm, happiness, happiness----


@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}

  I have never before known happiness in life.  And I cannot
possibly drive happiness away from me, merely because it comes
so late.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  And how long do you think this happiness will last?


@d{}
[Interrupting.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Whether it lasts or does not last, mother,
it doesn't matter now!


@d{}
[In anger.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Blind boy that you are!  Do you not see where all
this is leading you?


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  I don't want to look into the future.  I don't want to look
around me in any direction; I am only determined to live my own
life--at last!


@d{}
[With deep pain.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
And you call this life, Erhart!


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  Don't you see how lovely she is!


@d{}
[Wringing her hands.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
And I have to bear this load of shame
as well!


@d{}
[At the back, harshly and cuttingly.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Ho--you are used to
bearing things of that sort, Gunhild!


@d{}
[Imploringly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Borkman!


@d{}
[Similarly.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Father!


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Day after day I shall have to see my own son linked to a--a----


@d{}
[Interrupting her harshly.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
You shall see nothing of the kind,
mother!  You may make your mind easy on that point.  I shall not
remain here.


@d{}
[Quickly and with decision.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}
We are going away, Mrs. Borkman.


@d{}
[Turning pale.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Are you going away, too?  Together, no doubt?


@d{}
[Nodding.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}
Yes, I am going abroad, to the south.  I am taking
a young girl with me.  And Erhart is going along with us.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  With you--and a young girl?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}

  Yes.  It is little Frida Foldal, whom I have had living with me.
I want her to go abroad and get more instruction in music.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  So you are taking her with you?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}

  Yes; I can't well send her out into the world alone.


@d{}
[Suppressing a smile.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
What do you say to this, Erhart?


@d{}
[With some embarrassment, shrugging his shoulders.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Well,
mother, since Fanny will have it so----


@d{}
[Coldly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
And when does this distinguished party set out, if
one may ask?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}

  We are going at once--to-night.  My covered sledge is waiting
on the road, outside the Hinkels'.


@d{}
[Looking her from head to foot.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Aha! so that was what the
party meant?


@d{}
[Smiling.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}
Yes, Erhart and I were the whole party.  And little
Frida, of course.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  And where is she now?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}

  She is sitting in the sledge waiting for us.


@d{}
[In painful embarrassment.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Mother, surely you can understand?
I would have spared you all this--you and every one.


@d{}
[Looks at him, deeply pained.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
You would have gone away from
me without saying a good-bye?


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  Yes, I thought that would be best; best for all of us.  Our
boxes were packed and everything settled.  But of course
when you sent for me, I----  
@d{}
[Holding out his hands to her.]

@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Good-bye, mother.


@d{}
[With a gesture of repulsion.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Don't touch me!


@d{}
[Gently.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Is that your last word?


@d{}
[Sternly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Yes.


@d{}
[Turning.]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Good-bye to you, then, Aunt Ella.


@d{}
[Pressing his hands.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Good-bye, Erhart!  And live your life--
and be as happy--as happy as ever you can.


@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}

  Thanks, Aunt.  
@d{}
[Bowing to John Gabriel Borkman]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Good-bye, father.  
@d{}
[Whispers
to Mrs. Wilton]  
@l{"name":"Erhart Borkman"}
Let us get away, the sooner the better.


@d{}
[In a low voice.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}
Yes, let us.


@d{}
[With a malignant smile.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Mrs. Wilton, do you think you are
acting quite wisely in taking that girl with you?


@d{}
[Returning the smile, half ironically, half seriously.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}
Men
are so unstable, Mrs. Borkman.  And women too.  When Erhart is
done with me--and I with him--then it will be well for us both
that he, poor fellow, should have some one to fall back upon.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  But you yourself?


@l{"name":"Mrs. Wilton"}

  Oh, I shall know what to do, I assure you.  Good-bye to you all!

    
@d{}
[She bows and goes out by the hall door.  ERHART stands for a

Childless.

Then out into the storm
alone!  My hat!  My cloak!
    
@d{}
[He goes hastily towards the door.


@d{}
[In terror, stopping him.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
John Gabriel, where are you going?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Out into the storm of life, I tell you.  Let me go, Ella!


@d{}

@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
No, no, I won't let you out!  You are ill.
I can see it in your face!

ACT FOURTH


An open space outside the main building, which lies to the right.
    A projecting corner of it is visible, with a door approached by
    a flight of low stone steps.  The background consists of steep
    fir-clad slopes, quite close at hand.  On the left are small
    scattered trees, forming the margin of a wood.  The snowstorm
    has ceased; but the newly fallen snow lies deep around.  The
    fir-branches droop under heavy loads of snow.  The night is
    dark, with drifting clouds.  Now and then the moon gleams out
    faintly.  Only a dim light is reflected from the snow.

BORKMAN, MRS. BORKMAN and ELLA RENTHEIM are standing upon the
    steps, BORKMAN leaning wearily against the wall of the house.
    He has an old-fashioned cape thrown over his shoulders, holds
    a soft grey felt hat in one hand and a thick knotted stick in
    the other.  ELLA RENTHEIM carries her cloak over her arm.  MRS.
    BORKMAN's great shawl has slipped down over her shoulders, so
    that her hair is uncovered.



@e{"names":["John Gabriel Borkman","Mrs. Borkman","Ella Rentheim"]}

@d{}
[Barring the way for Mrs. Borkman]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Don't go after him, Gunhild!


@d{}
[In fear and agitation.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Let me pass, I say!  He must not go
away from me!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  It is utterly useless, I tell you!  You will never overtake him.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Let me go, Ella!  I will cry aloud after him all down the road.
And he must hear his mother's cry!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  He cannot hear you.  You may be sure he is in the sledge already.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  No, no; he can't be in the sledge yet!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  The doors are closed upon him long ago, believe me.


@d{}
[In despair.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
If he is in the sledge, then he is there with
her, with her--her!


@d{}
[Laughing gloomily.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Then he probably won't hear his mother's
cry.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  No, he will not hear it.  
@d{}
[Listening.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Hark! what is that?


@d{}
[Also listening.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
It sounds like sledge-bells.


@d{}
[With a suppressed scream.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
It is her sledge!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Perhaps it's another.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  No, no, it is Mrs. Wilton's covered sledge!  I know the silver
bells!  Hark!  Now they are driving right past here, at the foot
of the hill!


@d{}
[Quickly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Gunhild, if you want to cry out to him, now is the
time!  Perhaps after all----!  
@d{}
[The tinkle of the bells sounds
close at hand, in the wood.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Make haste, Gunhild!  Now they are
right under us!


@d{}
[Stands for a moment undecided, then she stiffens and says
sternly and coldly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
No.  I will not cry out to him.  Let Erhart
Borkman pass away from me--far, far away--to what he calls life
and happiness.
    
@d{}
[The sound dies away in the distance.


@d{}
[After a moment.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Now the bells are out of hearing.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  They sounded like funeral bells.


@d{}
[With a dry suppressed laugh.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Oho--it is not for me they are
ringing to-night!


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  No, but for me--and for him who has gone from me.


@d{}
[Nodding thoughtfully.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Who knows if, after all, they may not
be ringing in life and happiness for him, Gunhild.


@d{}
[With sudden animation, looking hard at her.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Life and
happiness, you say!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  For a little while at any rate.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Could you endure to let him know life and happiness, with her?


@d{}
[With warmth and feeling.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Indeed, I could, with all my heart
and soul!


@d{}
[Coldly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Then you must be richer than I am in the power of
love.


@d{}
[Looking far away.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Perhaps it is the lack of love that keeps
the power alive.


@d{}
[Fixing her eyes on her.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
If that is so, then I shall soon be
as rich as you, Ella.
    
@d{}
[She turns and goes into the house.


@d{}
[Stands for a time looking with a troubled expression at BORKMAN;
then lays her hand cautiously on his shoulder.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Come, John--you
must come in, too.


@d{}
[As if wakening.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
I?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes, this winter air is too keen for you; I can see that, John.
So come--come in with me--into the house, into the warmth.


@d{}
[Angrily.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Up to the gallery again, I suppose.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  No, rather into the room below.


@d{}
[His anger flaming forth.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Never will I set foot under that
roof again!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Where will you go then?  So late, and in the dark, John?


@d{}
[Putting on his hat.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
First of all, I will go out and see to
all my buried treasures.


@d{}
[Looking anxiously at him.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
John--I don't understand you.


@d{}
[With laughter, interrupted by coughing.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Oh, it is not hidden
plunder I mean; don't be afraid of that, Ella.  
@d{}
[Stopping, and
pointing outwards.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Do you see that man there?  Who is it?

    
@d{}
[VILHELM FOLDAL, in an old cape, covered with snow, with his
        hat-brim turned down, and a large umbrella in his hand,
        advances towards the corner of the house, laboriously
        stumbling through the snow.  He is noticeably lame in
        his left foot.


@e{"names":["Vilhelm Foldal"]}

@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Vilhelm!  What do you want with me again?


@d{}
[Looking up.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
Good heavens, are you out on the steps, John
Gabriel?  
@d{}
[Bowing.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
And Mrs. Borkman, too, I see.


@d{}
[Shortly.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
This is not Mrs. Borkman.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Oh, I beg pardon.  You see, I have lost my spectacles in the
snow.  But how is it that you, who never put your foot out of
doors----?


@d{}
[Carelessly and gaily.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
It is high time I should come out
into the open air again, don't you see?  Nearly three years in
detention--five years in prison--eight years in the gallery up
there----


@d{}
[Distressed.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Borkman, I beg you----


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Ah yes, yes, yes!


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  But I want to know what has brought you here.


@d{}
[Still standing at the foot of the steps.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
I wanted to come up
to you, John Gabriel.  I felt I must come to you, in the gallery.
Ah me, that gallery----!


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Did you want to come up to me after I had shown you the door?


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Oh, I couldn't let that stand in the way.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  What have you done to your foot?  I see you are limping?


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Yes, what do you think--I have been run over.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Run over!


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Yes, by a covered sledge.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Oho!


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  With two horses.  They came down the hill at a tearing gallop.
I couldn't get out of the way quick enough; and so----


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  And so they ran over you?


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  They came right down upon me, madam--or miss.  They came right
upon me and sent me rolling over and over in the snow--so that I
lost my spectacles and got my umbrella broken.  
@d{}
[Rubbing his leg.]

@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
And my ankle a little hurt too.


@d{}
[Laughing inwardly.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Do you know who were in that sledge,
Vilhelm?


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  No, how could I see?  It was a covered sledge, and the curtains
were down.  And the driver didn't stop a moment after he had sent
me spinning.  But it doesn't matter a bit, for----  
@d{}
[With an
outburst.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
Oh, I am so happy, so happy!


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Happy?


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Well, I don't exactly know what to call it.  But I think happy
is the nearest word.  For something wonderful has happened!  And
that is why I couldn't help--I had to come out and share my
happiness with you, John Gabriel.


@d{}
[Harshly.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Well, share away then!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Oh, but first take your friend indoors with you, Borkman.


@d{}
[Sternly.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
I have told you I will not go into the house.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  But don't you hear, he has been run over!


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Oh, we are all of us run over, sometime or other in life.  The
thing is to jump up again, and let no one see you are hurt.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  That is a profound saying, John Gabriel.  But I can easily tell
you my story out here, in a few words.


@d{}
[More mildly.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Yes, please do, Vilhelm.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Well, now you shall hear!  Only think, when I got home this
evening after I had been with you, what did I find but a letter.
Can you guess who it was from?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Possibly from your little Frida?


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Precisely!  Think of your hitting on it at once!  Yes, it was
a long letter from Frida.  A footman had brought it.  And can
you imagine what was in it?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Perhaps it was to say good-bye to her mother and you?


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Exactly!  How good you are at guessing, John Gabriel!  Yes, she
tells me that Mrs. Wilton has taken such a fancy to her, and she
is to go abroad with her and study music.  And Mrs. Wilton has
engaged a first-rate teacher who is to accompany them on the
journey--and to read with Frida.  For unfortunately she has been
a good deal neglected in some branches, you see.


@d{}
[Shaken with inward laughter.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Of course, of course--I see it
all quite clearly, Vilhelm.


@d{}
[Eagerly continuing.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
And only think, she knew nothing about
the arrangement until this evening; at that party, you know, h'm!
And yet she found time to write to me.  And the letter is such a
beautiful one--so warm and affectionate, I assure you.  There is
not a trace of contempt for her father in it.  And then what a
delicate thought it was to say good-bye to us by letter--before
she started.  
@d{}
[Laughing.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
But of course I can't let her go like
that.


@d{}
[Looks inquiringly at him.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
How so?


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  She tells me that they start early to-morrow morning; quite
early.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Oh indeed--to-morrow?  Does she tell you that?


@d{}
[Laughing and rubbing his hands.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
Yes; but I know a trick worth
two of that, you see!  I am going straight up to Mrs. Wilton's----


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  This evening?


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Oh, it's not so very late yet.  And even if the house is shut
up, I shall ring; without hesitation.  For I must and will see
Frida before she starts.  Good-night, good-night!
    
@d{}
[Makes a movement to go.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Stop a moment, my poor Vilhelm; you may spare yourself that
heavy bit of road.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Oh, you are thinking of my ankle----


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Yes; and in any case you won't get in at Mrs. Wilton's.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Yes, indeed I will.  I'll go on ringing and knocking till some
one comes and lets me in.  For I must and will see Frida.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Your daughter has gone already, Mr. Foldal.


@d{}
[Stands as though thunderstruck.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
Has Frida gone already!  Are
you quite sure?  Who told you?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  We had it from her future teacher.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Indeed?  And who is he?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  A certain Mr. Erhart Borkman.


@d{}
[Beaming with joy.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
Your son, John Gabriel?  Is he going with
them?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Yes; it is he that is to help Mrs. Wilton with little Frida's
education.


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Oh, Heaven be praised!  Then the child is in the best of hands.
But is it quite certain that they have started with her already?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  They took her away in that sledge which ran you over in the road.


@d{}
[Clasping his hands.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
To think that my little Frida was in that
magnificent sledge!


@d{}
[Nodding.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Yes, yes, Vilhelm, your daughter has come to drive
in her carriage.  And Master Erhart, too.  Tell me, did you notice
the silver bells?


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Yes, indeed.  Silver bells did you say?  Were they silver?  Real,
genuine silver bells?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  You may be quite sure of that.  Everything was genuine--both
outside and in.


@d{}
[In quiet emotion.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
Isn't it strange how fortune can sometimes
befriend one?  It is my--my little gift of song that has transmuted
itself into music in Frida.  So after all, it is not for nothing
that I was born a poet.  For now she is going forth into the great
wide world, that I once yearned so passionately to see.  Little
Frida sets out in a splendid covered sledge with silver bells on
the harness----


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  And runs over her father.


@d{}
[Happily.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
Oh, pooh!  What does it matter about me, if only
the child----!  Well, so I am too late, then, after all.  I must
go home again and comfort her mother.  I left her crying in the
kitchen.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  Crying?


@d{}
[Smiling.]  
@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}
Yes, would you believe it, she was crying her eyes
out when I came away.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  And you are laughing, Vilhelm?


@l{"name":"Vilhelm Foldal"}

  Yes, _I_ am, of course.  But she, poor thing, she doesn't know
any better, you see.  Well, good-bye!  It's a good thing I have
the tramway so handy.  Good-bye, good-bye, John Gabriel.  Good-bye,
Madam.

@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  I have never seen you like this before.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  No, for I suppose you have never seen an escaped convict before.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Oh, do come into the house with me, John!


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  It is no use trying to lure me in.  I have told you----

@d{}

now.

again!

a little fresh air before coming in.

Never under a roof again!  It
is so good to be out here in the night.  If I went up into the
gallery now, ceiling and walls would shrink together and crush
me--crush me flat as a fly.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  But where will you go, then?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  I will simply go on, and on, and on.  I will try if I cannot
make my way to freedom, and life, and human beings again.  Will
you go with me, Ella?

        It conceals them little by little, until they are quite
        lost to sight.  The house and the open space disappear.
        The landscape, consisting of wooded slopes and ridges,
        slowly changes and grows wilder and wilder.

@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Where are we going, John?
I don't recognise this place.


@d{}
[Higher up.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Just follow my footprints in the snow!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  But why need we climb so high?


@d{}
[Nearer at hand.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
We must go up the winding path.


@d{}
[Still hidden.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Oh, but I can't go much further.


@d{}
[On the verge of the wood to the right.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Come, come!  We are
not far from the view now.  There used to be a seat there.


@d{}
[Appearing among the trees.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Do you remember it?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  You can rest there.

    
@d{}
[They have emerged upon a small high-lying, open plateau in
        the wood.  The mountain rises abruptly behind them.  To
        the left, far below, an extensive fiord landscape, with
        high ranges in the distance, towering one above the other.
        On the plateau, to the left, a dead fir-tree with a bench
        under it.  The snow lies deep upon the plateau.

    [BORKMAN and, after him, ELLA RENTHEIM enter from the right
        and wade with difficulty through the snow.


@e{"names":["John Gabriel Borkman","Ella Rentheim"]}

@d{}
[Stopping at the verge of the steep declivity on the left.]

@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Come here, Ella, and you shall see.


@d{}
[Coming up to him.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
What do you want to show me, John?


@d{}
[Pointing outwards.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Do you see how free and open the country
lies before us--away to the far horizon?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  We have often sat on this bench before, and looked out into a
much, much further distance.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  It was a dreamland we then looked out over.


@d{}
[Nodding sadly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
It was the dreamland of our life, yes.  And
now that land is buried in snow.  And the old tree is dead.


@d{}
[Not listening to her.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Can you see the smoke of the great
steamships out on the fiord?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  No.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  I can.  They come and they go.  They weave a network of
fellowship all round the world.  They shed light and warmth over
the souls of men in many thousands of homes.  That was what I
dreamed of doing.


@d{}
[Softly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
And it remained a dream.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  It remained a dream, yes.  
@d{}
[Listening.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
And hark, down by the
river, dear!  The factories are working!  My factories!  All those
that I would have created!  Listen!  Do you hear them humming?  The
night shift is on--so they are working night and day.  Hark! hark!
the wheels are whirling and the bands are flashing--round and
round and round.  Can't you hear, Ella?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  No.


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  I can hear it.


@d{}
[Anxiously.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
I think you are mistaken, John.


@d{}
[More and more fired up.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Oh, but all these--they are only like
the outworks around the kingdom, I tell you!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  The kingdom, you say?  What kingdom?


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  My kingdom, of course!  The kingdom I was on the point of
conquering when I--when I died.


@d{}
[Shaken, in a low voice.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Oh, John, John!


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  And now there it lies--defenceless, masterless--exposed to all
the robbers and plunderers.  Ella, do you see the mountain chains
there--far away?  They soar, they tower aloft, one behind the
other!  That is my vast, my infinite, inexhaustible kingdom!


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Oh, but there comes an icy blast from that kingdom, John!


@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}

  That blast is the breath of life to me.  That blast comes to
me like a greeting from subject spirits.  I seem to touch them,
the prisoned millions; I can see the veins of metal stretch out
their winding, branching, luring arms to me.  I saw them before
my eyes like living shapes, that night when I stood in the
strong-room with the candle in my hand.  You begged to be
liberated, and I tried to free you.  But my strength failed
me; and the treasure sank back into the deep again.  
@d{}
[With
outstretched hands.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
But I will whisper it to you here in the
stillness of the night: I love you, as you lie there spellbound
in the deeps and the darkness!  I love you, unborn treasures,
yearning for the light!  I love you, with all your shining train
of power and glory!  I love you, love you, love you!


@d{}
[In suppressed but rising agitation.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Yes, your love is still
down there, John.  It has always been rooted there.  But here, in
the light of day, here there was a living, warm, human heart that
throbbed and glowed for you.  And this heart you crushed.  Oh worse
than that!  Ten times worse!  You sold it for--for----


@d{}
[Trembles; a cold shudder seems to go through him.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
For the
kingdom--and the power--and the glory--you mean?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  Yes, that is what I mean.  I have said it once before to-night:
you have murdered the love-life in the woman who loved you.  And
whom you loved in return, so far as you could love any one.  
@d{}
[With
uplifted arm.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
And therefore I prophesy to you, John Gabriel
Borkman--you will never touch the price you demanded for the
murder.  You will never enter in triumph into your cold, dark
kingdom!


@d{}
[Staggers to the bench and seats himself heavily.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
I almost
fear your prophecy will come true, Ella.


@d{}
[Going up to him.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
You must not fear it, John.  That is the
best thing that can happen to you.


@d{}
[With a shriek; clutching at his breast.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Ah----!  
@d{}
[Feebly.]

@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
Now it let me go again.


@d{}
[Shaking him.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
What was it, John?


@d{}
[Sinking down against the back of the seat.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
It was a hand of
ice that clutched at my heart.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  John!  Did you feel the ice-hand again!


@d{}
[Murmurs.]  
@l{"name":"John Gabriel Borkman"}
No.  No ice-hand.  It was a metal hand.
    
@d{}
[He sinks right down upon the bench.


@d{}
[Tears off her cloak and throws it over him.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Lie still where
you are!  I will go and bring help for you.

    
@d{}
[She goes a step or two towards the right; then she stops,
        returns, and carefully feels his pulse and touches his
        face.


@d{}
[Softly and firmly.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
No.  It is best so, John Borkman.  Best
for you.

    
@d{}
[She spreads the cloak closer around him, and sinks down in
        the snow in front of the bench.  A short silence.

    [MRS. BORKMAN, wrapped in a mantle, comes through the wood
        on the right.  THE MAID goes before her carrying a lantern.


@e{"names":["Mrs. Borkman","The Maid"]}

@d{}
[Throwing the light upon the snow.]  
@l{"name":"The Maid"}
Yes, yes, ma'am, here are
their tracks.


@d{}
[Peering around.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Yes, here they are!  They are sitting there
on the bench.  
@d{}
[Calls.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Ella!


@d{}
[Rising.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Are you looking for us?


@d{}
[Sternly.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Yes, you see I have to.


@d{}
[Pointing.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Look, there he lies, Gunhild.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Sleeping?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  A long, deep sleep, I think.


@d{}
[With an outburst.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Ella!  
@d{}
[Controls herself and asks in a low
voice.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Did he do it--of his own accord?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  No.


@d{}
[Relieved.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Not by his own hand then?


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  No.  It was an ice-cold metal hand that gripped him by the heart.


@d{}
[To The Maid]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
Go for help.  Get the men to come up from the
farm.


@l{"name":"The Maid"}

  Yes, I will, ma'am.  
@d{}
[To herself.]  
@l{"name":"The Maid"}

@d{}

@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
So the night air has killed him----


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  So it appears.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  ----strong man that he was.


@d{}
[Coming in front of the bench.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Will you not look at him,
Gunhild?


@d{}
[With a gesture of repulsion.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
No, no, no.  
@d{}
[Lowering her
voice.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
He was a miner's son, John Gabriel Borkman.  He could
not live in the fresh air.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  It was rather the cold that killed him.


@d{}
[Shakes her head.]  
@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}
The cold, you say?  The cold--that had
killed him long ago.


@d{}
[Nodding to her.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
Yes--and changed us two into shadows.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  You are right there.


@d{}
[With a painful smile.]  
@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}
A dead man and two shadows--that is
what the cold has made of us.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  Yes, the coldness of heart.--And now I think we two may hold
out our hands to each other, Ella.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  I think we may, now.


@l{"name":"Mrs. Borkman"}

  We twin sisters--over him we have both loved.


@l{"name":"Ella Rentheim"}

  We two shadows--over the dead man.

        of it, take each other's hand.
