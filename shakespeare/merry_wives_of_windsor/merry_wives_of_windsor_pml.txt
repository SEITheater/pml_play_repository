The Merry Wives of Windsor

ACT I.

SCENE 1.  Windsor. Before PAGE'S house.

[Enter JUSTICE SHALLOW, SLENDER, and SIR HUGH Evans]


@e{"names":["Slender","Shallow","Evans"]}

@l{"name":"Shallow"}

Sir Hugh, persuade me not; I will make a Star Chamber matter
of it; if he were twenty Sir John Falstaffs, he shall not
abuse Robert Shallow, esquire.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

In the county of Gloucester, Justice of Peace, and 'coram.'


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

Ay, cousin Slender, and 'cust-alorum.'


@l{"name":"Slender"}

Ay, and 'rato-lorum' too; and a gentleman born, Master Parson,
who writes himself 'armigero' in any bill, warrant, quittance,
or obligation--'armigero.'


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

Ay, that I do; and have done any time these three hundred years.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

All his successors, gone before him, hath done't; and all his
ancestors, that come after him, may: they may give the dozen
white luces in their coat.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

It is an old coat.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

The dozen white louses do become an old coat well; it agrees well,
passant; it is a familiar beast to man, and signifies love.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

The luce is the fresh fish; the salt fish is an old
coat.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

I may quarter, coz?


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

You may, by marrying.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

It is marring indeed, if he quarter it.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

Not a whit.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

Yes, py'r lady! If he has a quarter of your coat, there is but three
skirts for yourself, in my simple conjectures; but that is all one.
If Sir John Falstaff have committed disparagements unto you, I am of
the church, and will be glad to do my benevolence to make atonements
and compremises between you.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

The Council shall hear it; it is a riot.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

It is not meet the Council hear a riot; there is no fear of Got in
a riot; the Council, look you, shall desire to hear the fear of Got,
and not to hear a riot; take your vizaments in that.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

Ha! o' my life, if I were young again, the sword should end it.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

It is petter that friends is the sword and end it; and there is
also another device in my prain, which peradventure prings goot
discretions with it. There is Anne Page, which is daughter to
Master George Page, which is pretty virginity.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and speaks small like a woman.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

It is that fery person for all the orld, as just as you will desire;
and seven hundred pounds of moneys, and gold, and silver, is
her grandsire upon his death's-bed--Got deliver to a joyful
resurrections!--give, when she is able to overtake seventeen years
old. It were a goot motion if we leave our pribbles and prabbles,
and desire a marriage between Master Abraham and Mistress Anne Page.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

Did her grandsire leave her seven hundred pound?


@l{"name":"Evans"}

Ay, and her father is make her a petter penny.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

I know the young gentlewoman; she has good gifts.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

Seven hundred pounds, and possibilities, is goot gifts.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

Well, let us see honest Master Page. Is Falstaff there?


@l{"name":"Evans"}

Shall I tell you a lie? I do despise a liar as I do despise one that
is false; or as I despise one that is not true. The knight Sir John
is there; and, I beseech you, be ruled by your well-willers. I will
peat the door for Master Page.

@d{}
[Knocks.] 
@l{"name":"Evans"}
What, hoa! Got pless your house here!


@d{}
[Within.] 
@l{"name":"Page"}
Who's there?


@l{"name":"Evans"}

Here is Got's plessing, and your friend, and Justice Shallow; and
here young Master Slender, that peradventures shall tell you another
tale, if matters grow to your likings.


@d{}
[Enter Page]


@e{"names":["Page"]}

@l{"name":"Page"}

I am glad to see your worships well. I thank you for my venison,
Master Shallow.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

Master Page, I am glad to see you; much good do it your good heart!
I wished your venison better; it was ill killed. How doth good
Mistress Page?--and I thank you always with my heart, la! with my
heart.


@l{"name":"Page"}

Sir, I thank you.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

Sir, I thank you; by yea and no, I do.


@l{"name":"Page"}

I am glad to see you, good Master Slender.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

How does your fallow greyhound, sir? I heard say he was outrun on
Cotsall.


@l{"name":"Page"}

It could not be judged, sir.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

You'll not confess, you'll not confess.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

That he will not: 'tis your fault; 'tis your fault. 'Tis a good dog.


@l{"name":"Page"}

A cur, sir.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

Sir, he's a good dog, and a fair dog; can there be more said? he is
good, and fair. Is Sir John Falstaff here?


@l{"name":"Page"}

Sir, he is within; and I would I could do a good office
between you.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

It is spoke as a Christians ought to speak.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

He hath wronged me, Master Page.


@l{"name":"Page"}

Sir, he doth in some sort confess it.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

If it be confessed, it is not redressed: is not that so, Master
Page? He hath wronged me; indeed he hath;--at a word, he hath,
--believe me; Robert Shallow, esquire, saith he is wronged.


@l{"name":"Page"}

Here comes Sir John.


@d{}
[Enter SIR JOHN FALSTAFF, BARDOLPH, NYM, and Pistol]


@e{"names":["Falstaff","Bardolph","Nym","Pistol"]}

@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Now, Master Shallow, you'll complain of me to the King?


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

Knight, you have beaten my men, killed my deer, and broke open my
lodge.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

But not kiss'd your keeper's daughter?


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

Tut, a pin! this shall be answered.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

I will answer it straight: I have done all this. That is now answered.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

The Council shall know this.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

'Twere better for you if it were known in counsel: you'll be laughed
at.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

Pauca verba, Sir John; goot worts.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Good worts! good cabbage! Slender, I broke your head; what matter
have you against me?


@l{"name":"Slender"}

Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against you; and against your
cony-catching rascals, Bardolph, Nym, and Pistol. They carried me
to the tavern, and made me drunk, and afterwards picked my pocket.


@l{"name":"Bardolph"}

You Banbury cheese!


@l{"name":"Slender"}

Ay, it is no matter.


@l{"name":"Pistol"}

How now, Mephostophilus!


@l{"name":"Slender"}

Ay, it is no matter.


@l{"name":"Nym"}

Slice, I say! pauca, pauca; slice! That's my humour.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

Where's Simple, my man? Can you tell, cousin?


@l{"name":"Evans"}

Peace, I pray you. Now let us understand. There is three umpires in
this matter, as I understand: that is--Master Page, fidelicet Master
Page; and there is myself, fidelicet myself; and the three party is,
lastly and finally, mine host of the Garter.


@l{"name":"Page"}

We three to hear it and end it between them.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

Fery goot: I will make a prief of it in my note-book; and we will
afterwards ork upon the cause with as great discreetly as we can.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Pistol!


@l{"name":"Pistol"}

He hears with ears.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

The tevil and his tam! what phrase is this, 'He hears with ear'?
Why, it is affectations.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Pistol, did you pick Master Slender's purse?


@l{"name":"Slender"}

Ay, by these gloves, did he--or I would I might never come in mine
own great chamber again else!--of seven groats in mill-sixpences,
and two Edward shovel-boards that cost me two shilling and two pence
a-piece of Yead Miller, by these gloves.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Is this true, Pistol?


@l{"name":"Evans"}

No, it is false, if it is a pick-purse.


@l{"name":"Pistol"}

Ha, thou mountain-foreigner!--Sir John and master mine,
I combat challenge of this latten bilbo.
Word of denial in thy labras here!
Word of denial! Froth and scum, thou liest.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

By these gloves, then, 'twas he.


@l{"name":"Nym"}

Be avised, sir, and pass good humours; I will say 'marry trap' with
you, if you run the nuthook's humour on me; that is the very note
of it.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

By this hat, then, he in the red face had it; for though I cannot
remember what I did when you made me drunk, yet I am not altogether
an ass.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

What say you, Scarlet and John?


@l{"name":"Bardolph"}

Why, sir, for my part, I say the gentleman had drunk himself out of
his five sentences.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

It is his 'five senses'; fie, what the ignorance is!


@l{"name":"Bardolph"}

And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashier'd; and so conclusions
passed the careires.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

Ay, you spake in Latin then too; but 'tis no matter; I'll ne'er be
drunk whilst I live again, but in honest, civil, godly company, for
this trick; if I be drunk, I'll be drunk with those that have the
fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

So Got udge me, that is a virtuous mind.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

You hear all these matters denied, gentlemen; you hear it.


@d{}
[Enter ANNE PAGE with wine; MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS Page]


@e{"names":["Anne","Mistress Ford","Mistress Page"]}

@l{"name":"Page"}

Nay, daughter, carry the wine in; we'll drink within.


@d{}
[Exit ANNE Page]


@x{"names":["Anne"]}

@l{"name":"Slender"}

O heaven! this is Mistress Anne Page.


@l{"name":"Page"}

How now, Mistress Ford!


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well met; by your leave,
good mistress. 
@d{}
[Kissing her.]


@l{"name":"Page"}

Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we have a hot venison pasty
to dinner; come, gentlemen, I hope we shall drink down all unkindness.


@d{}
[Exeunt all but SHALLOW, SLENDER, and Evans]


@x{"names":["Falstaff","Mistress Ford","Mistress Page","Nym","Page","Pistol","Bardolph"]}

@l{"name":"Slender"}

I had rather than forty shillings I had my Book of Songs and Sonnets
here.


@d{}
[Enter Simple]


@e{"names":["Simple"]}

@l{"name":"Slender"}
How, Simple! Where have you been? I must wait on myself, must I? You
have not the Book of Riddles about you, have you?


@l{"name":"Simple"}

Book of Riddles! why, did you not lend it to Alice Shortcake upon
Allhallowmas last, a fortnight afore Michaelmas?


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

Come, coz; come, coz; we stay for you. A word with you, coz; marry,
this, coz: there is, as 'twere, a tender, a kind of tender, made
afar off by Sir Hugh here: do you understand me?


@l{"name":"Slender"}

Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable; if it be so, I shall do that
that is reason.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

Nay, but understand me.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

So I do, sir.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

Give ear to his motions, Master Slender: I will description the
matter to you, if you pe capacity of it.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says; I pray you pardon me; he's
a justice of peace in his country, simple though I stand here.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

But that is not the question; the question is concerning your marriage.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

Ay, there's the point, sir.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

Marry is it; the very point of it; to Mistress Anne Page.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any reasonable demands.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

But can you affection the 'oman? Let us command to know that of your
mouth or of your lips; for divers philosophers hold that the lips is
parcel of the mouth: therefore, precisely, can you carry your good
will to the maid?


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?


@l{"name":"Slender"}

I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that would do reason.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

Nay, Got's lords and his ladies! you must speak possitable, if you can
carry her your desires towards her.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

That you must. Will you, upon good dowry, marry her?


@l{"name":"Slender"}

I will do a greater thing than that upon your request, cousin, in any
reason.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz; what I do is to pleasure
you, coz. Can you love the maid?


@l{"name":"Slender"}

I will marry her, sir, at your request; but if there be no great love
in the beginning, yet heaven may decrease it upon better acquaintance,
when we are married and have more occasion to know one another; I hope
upon familiarity will grow more contempt. But if you say 'Marry her,'
I will marry her; that I am freely dissolved, and dissolutely.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

It is a fery discretion answer; save, the fall is in the ort
'dissolutely:' the ort is, according to our meaning, 'resolutely.'
His meaning is good.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

Ay, I think my cousin meant well.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

Ay, or else I would I might be hanged, la!


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

Here comes fair Mistress Anne. 


@d{}
[Re-enter ANNE Page]


@e{"names":["Anne"]}

@l{"name":"Shallow"}
Would I were young for your sake, Mistress Anne!


@l{"name":"Anne"}

The dinner is on the table; my father desires your worships' company.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

I will wait on him, fair Mistress Anne!


@l{"name":"Evans"}

Od's plessed will! I will not be absence at the grace.


@d{}
[Exeunt SHALLOW and Evans]


@x{"names":["Evans","Shallow"]}

@l{"name":"Anne"}

Will't please your worship to come in, sir?


@l{"name":"Slender"}

No, I thank you, forsooth, heartily; I am very well.


@l{"name":"Anne"}

The dinner attends you, sir.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

I am not a-hungry, I thank you, forsooth. Go, sirrah, for all you are
my man, go wait upon my cousin Shallow.


@d{}
[Exit Simple]


@x{"names":["Simple"]}

@l{"name":"Slender"}
A justice of peace sometime may be beholding to his friend for a man.
I keep but three men and a boy yet, till my mother be dead. But what
though? Yet I live like a poor gentleman born.

@l{"name":"Anne"}
I may not go in without your worship: they will not sit till you come.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

I' faith, I'll eat nothing; I thank you as much as though I did.


@l{"name":"Anne"}

I pray you, sir, walk in.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

I had rather walk here, I thank you. I bruised my shin th' other day
with playing at sword and dagger with a master of fence; three veneys
for a dish of stewed prunes--and, by my troth, I cannot abide the
smell of hot meat since. Why do your dogs bark so? Be there bears i'
the town?


@l{"name":"Anne"}

I think there are, sir; I heard them talked of.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

I love the sport well; but I shall as soon quarrel at it as any man
in England. You are afraid, if you see the bear loose, are you not?


@l{"name":"Anne"}

Ay, indeed, sir.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

That's meat and drink to me now. I have seen Sackerson loose twenty
times, and have taken him by the chain; but I warrant you, the women
have so cried and shrieked at it that it passed; but women, indeed,
cannot abide 'em; they are very ill-favoured rough things.


@d{}
[Re-enter Page]


@e{"names":["Page"]}

@l{"name":"Page"}

Come, gentle Master Slender, come; we stay for you.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

I'll eat nothing, I thank you, sir.


@l{"name":"Page"}

By cock and pie, you shall not choose, sir! come, come.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

Nay, pray you lead the way.


@l{"name":"Page"}

Come on, sir.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

Mistress Anne, yourself shall go first.


@l{"name":"Anne"}

Not I, sir; pray you keep on.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

Truly, I will not go first; truly, la! I will not do you that wrong.


@l{"name":"Anne"}

I pray you, sir.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

I'll rather be unmannerly than troublesome. You do yourself wrong
indeed, la!

SCENE 2. The same.

[Enter SIR HUGH EVANS and Simple]


@e{"names":["Evans","Simple"]}

@l{"name":"Evans"}

Go your ways, and ask of Doctor Caius' house which is the way; and
there dwells one Mistress Quickly, which is in the manner of his
nurse, or his dry nurse, or his cook, or his laundry, his washer,
and his wringer.


@l{"name":"Simple"}

Well, sir.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

Nay, it is petter yet. Give her this letter; for it is a 'oman that
altogether's acquaintance with Mistress Anne Page; and the letter
is to desire and require her to solicit your master's desires to
Mistress Anne Page. I pray you be gone: I will make an end of my
dinner; there's pippins and cheese to come.

SCENE 3. A room in the Garter Inn.

[Enter FALSTAFF, HOST, BARDOLPH, NYM, PISTOL, and Robin]


@e{"names":["Falstaff","Host","Bardolph","Nym","Pistol","Robin"]}

@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Mine host of the Garter!


@l{"name":"Host"}

What says my bully rook? Speak scholarly and wisely.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Truly, mine host, I must turn away some of my followers.


@l{"name":"Host"}

Discard, bully Hercules; cashier; let them wag; trot, trot.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

I sit at ten pounds a week.


@l{"name":"Host"}

Thou'rt an emperor, Caesar, Keiser, and Pheazar. I will entertain
Bardolph; he shall draw, he shall tap; said I well, bully Hector?


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Do so, good mine host.


@l{"name":"Host"}

I have spoke; let him follow. 
@d{}
[To BARDOLPH] 
@l{"name":"Host"}
Let me see thee froth and
lime. I am at a word; follow.


@d{}
[Exit.]


@x{"names":["Host"]}

@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Bardolph, follow him. A tapster is a good trade; an old cloak makes
a new jerkin; a withered serving-man a fresh tapster. Go; adieu.


@l{"name":"Bardolph"}

It is a life that I have desired; I will thrive.


@l{"name":"Pistol"}

O base Hungarian wight! Wilt thou the spigot wield?


@d{}
[Exit Bardolph]


@x{"names":["Bardolph"]}

@l{"name":"Nym"}

He was gotten in drink. Is not the humour conceited?


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

I am glad I am so acquit of this tinder-box: his thefts were too open;
his filching was like an unskilful singer--he kept not time.


@l{"name":"Nym"}

The good humour is to steal at a minim's rest.


@l{"name":"Pistol"}

'Convey' the wise it call. 'Steal!' foh! A fico for the phrase!


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Well, sirs, I am almost out at heels.


@l{"name":"Pistol"}

Why, then, let kibes ensue.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

There is no remedy; I must cony-catch; I must shift.


@l{"name":"Pistol"}

Young ravens must have food.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Which of you know Ford of this town?


@l{"name":"Pistol"}

I ken the wight; he is of substance good.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

My honest lads, I will tell you what I am about.


@l{"name":"Pistol"}

Two yards, and more.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

No quips now, Pistol. Indeed, I am in the waist two yards about; but
I am now about no waste; I am about thrift. Briefly, I do mean to
make love to Ford's wife; I spy entertainment in her; she discourses,
she carves, she gives the leer of invitation; I can construe the
action of her familiar style; and the hardest voice of her behaviour,
to be Englished rightly, is 'I am Sir John Falstaff's.'


@l{"name":"Pistol"}

He hath studied her will, and translated her will out of honesty into
English.


@l{"name":"Nym"}

The anchor is deep; will that humour pass?


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Now, the report goes she has all the rule of her husband's purse; he
hath a legion of angels.


@l{"name":"Pistol"}

As many devils entertain; and 'To her, boy,' say I.


@l{"name":"Nym"}

The humour rises; it is good; humour me the angels.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

I have writ me here a letter to her; and here another to Page's wife,
who even now gave me good eyes too, examined my parts with most
judicious oeillades; sometimes the beam of her view gilded my foot,
sometimes my portly belly.


@l{"name":"Pistol"}

Then did the sun on dunghill shine.


@l{"name":"Nym"}

I thank thee for that humour.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

O! she did so course o'er my exteriors with such a greedy intention
that the appetite of her eye did seem to scorch me up like a
burning-glass. Here's another letter to her: she bears the purse
too; she is a region in Guiana, all gold and bounty. I will be
cheator to them both, and they shall be exchequers to me; they shall
be my East and West Indies, and I will trade to them both. Go, bear
thou this letter to Mistress Page; and thou this to Mistress Ford.
We will thrive, lads, we will thrive.


@l{"name":"Pistol"}

Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,
And by my side wear steel? then Lucifer take all!


@l{"name":"Nym"}

I will run no base humour. Here, take the humour-letter; I will keep
the haviour of reputation.


@d{}
[To ROBIN] 
@l{"name":"Falstaff"}
Hold, sirrah; bear you these letters tightly;
Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.
Rogues, hence, avaunt! vanish like hailstones, go;
Trudge, plod away o' hoof; seek shelter, pack!
Falstaff will learn the humour of this age;
French thrift, you rogues; myself, and skirted page.


@d{}
[Exeunt FALSTAFF and Robin]


@x{"names":["Falstaff","Robin"]}

@l{"name":"Pistol"}

Let vultures gripe thy guts! for gourd and fullam holds,
And high and low beguile the rich and poor;
Tester I'll have in pouch when thou shalt lack,
Base Phrygian Turk!


@l{"name":"Nym"}

I have operations in my head which be humours of revenge.


@l{"name":"Pistol"}

Wilt thou revenge?


@l{"name":"Nym"}

By welkin and her star!


@l{"name":"Pistol"}

With wit or steel?


@l{"name":"Nym"}

With both the humours, I:
I will discuss the humour of this love to Page.


@l{"name":"Pistol"}

     And I to Ford shall eke unfold
       How Falstaff, varlet vile,
     His dove will prove, his gold will hold,
       And his soft couch defile.


@l{"name":"Nym"}

My humour shall not cool: I will incense Page to deal with poison;
I will possess him with yellowness, for the revolt of mine is
dangerous: that is my true humour.


@l{"name":"Pistol"}

Thou art the Mars of malcontents; I second thee; troop on.

@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

What, John Rugby! 


@d{}
[Enter Rugby]


@e{"names":["Rugby"]}

@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}
I pray thee go to the casement, and see if you can see my master,
Master Doctor Caius, coming: if he do, i' faith, and find anybody
in the house, here will be an old abusing of God's patience and the
King's English.


@l{"name":"Rugby"}

I'll go watch.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Go; and we'll have a posset for't soon at night, in faith, at the
latter end of a sea-coal fire.


@d{}
[Exit Rugby]


@x{"names":["Rugby"]}

@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}
An honest, willing, kind fellow, as ever servant shall come in house
withal; and, I warrant you, no tell-tale nor no breed-bate; his worst
fault is that he is given to prayer; he is something peevish that
way; but nobody but has his fault; but let that pass. Peter Simple
you say your name is?


@l{"name":"Simple"}

Ay, for fault of a better.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

And Master Slender's your master?


@l{"name":"Simple"}

Ay, forsooth.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Does he not wear a great round beard, like a glover's paring-knife?


@l{"name":"Simple"}

No, forsooth; he hath but a little whey face, with a little yellow
beard--a cane-coloured beard.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

A softly-sprighted man, is he not?


@l{"name":"Simple"}

Ay, forsooth; but he is as tall a man of his hands as any is between
this and his head; he hath fought with a warrener.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

How say you?--O! I should remember him. Does he not hold up his head,
as it were, and strut in his gait?


@l{"name":"Simple"}

Yes, indeed, does he.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Well, heaven send Anne Page no worse fortune! Tell Master Parson
Evans I will do what I can for your master: Anne is a good girl,
and I wish--

Out, alas! here comes my master.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

We shall all be shent. Run in here, good young man; go into this
closet. 
@d{}
[Shuts SIMPLE in the closet.] 
@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}
He will not stay long. What,

Ay, forsooth, I'll fetch it you. [Aside] I am glad he went not in

Verefore shall I be content-a?


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

The young man is an honest man.


@l{"name":"Doctor Caius"}

What shall de honest man do in my closet? dere is no honest man dat

@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

I beseech you, be not so phlegmatic. Hear the truth of it: he came of
an errand to me from Parson Hugh.


@l{"name":"Doctor Caius"}

Vell.


@l{"name":"Simple"}

Ay, forsooth, to desire her to--


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Peace, I pray you.


@l{"name":"Doctor Caius"}

Peace-a your tongue!--Speak-a your tale.


@l{"name":"Simple"}

To desire this honest gentlewoman, your maid, to speak a good word to
Mistress Anne Page for my master, in the way of marriage.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

This is all, indeed, la! but I'll ne'er put my finger in the fire,
and need not.


@l{"name":"Doctor Caius"}

Sir Hugh send-a you?--Rugby, baillez me some paper: tarry you a
little-a while. 
@d{}
[Writes.]


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

I am glad he is so quiet: if he had been throughly moved, you should
have heard him so loud and so melancholy. But notwithstanding, man,
I'll do you your master what good I can; and the very yea and the no
is, the French doctor, my master--I may call him my master, look you,
for I keep his house; and I wash, wring, brew, bake, scour, dress
meat and drink, make the beds, and do all myself--


@l{"name":"Simple"}

'Tis a great charge to come under one body's hand.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Are you avis'd o' that? You shall find it a great charge; and to be
up early and down late; but notwithstanding,--to tell you in your
ear,--I would have no words of it--my master himself is in love with
Mistress Anne Page; but notwithstanding that, I know Anne's mind,
that's neither here nor there.


@l{"name":"Doctor Caius"}

You jack'nape; give-a dis letter to Sir Hugh; by gar, it is a
shallenge: I will cut his troat in de Park; and I will teach a scurvy
jack-a-nape priest to meddle or make. You may be gone; it is not good
you tarry here: by gar, I will cut all his two stones; by gar, he
shall not have a stone to throw at his dog.

Alas, he speaks but for his friend.

It is no matter-a ver dat:--do not you tell-a me dat I shall have

appointed mine host of de Jartiere to measure our weapon. By gar, I
vill myself have Anne Page.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Sir, the maid loves you, and all shall be well. We must give folks
leave to prate: what, the good-jer!


@l{"name":"Doctor Caius"}

Rugby, come to the court vit me. By gar, if I have not Anne Page,
I shall turn your head out of my door. Follow my heels, Rugby.

@l{"name":"Fenton"}

How now, good woman! how dost thou?


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

The better, that it pleases your good worship to ask.


@l{"name":"Fenton"}

What news? how does pretty Mistress Anne?


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

In truth, sir, and she is pretty, and honest, and gentle; and one that
is your friend, I can tell you that by the way; I praise heaven for it.


@l{"name":"Fenton"}

Shall I do any good, thinkest thou? Shall I not lose my suit?


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Troth, sir, all is in His hands above; but notwithstanding, Master
Fenton, I'll be sworn on a book she loves you. Have not your worship
a wart above your eye?


@l{"name":"Fenton"}

Yes, marry, have I; what of that?


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Well, thereby hangs a tale; good faith, it is such another Nan; but,
I detest, an honest maid as ever broke bread. We had an hour's talk
of that wart; I shall never laugh but in that maid's company;--but,
indeed, she is given too much to allicholy and musing. But for you
--well, go to.


@l{"name":"Fenton"}

Well, I shall see her to-day. Hold, there's money for thee; let me
have thy voice in my behalf: if thou seest her before me, commend me.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Will I? i' faith, that we will; and I will tell your worship more of
the wart the next time we have confidence; and of other wooers.


@l{"name":"Fenton"}

Well, farewell; I am in great haste now.

Farewell to your worship.--

ACT II.

SCENE 1. Before PAGE'S house

[Enter MISTRESS PAGE, with a letter.]


@e{"names":["Mistress Page"]}

@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

What! have I scaped love-letters in the holiday-time of my beauty,
and am I now a subject for them? Let me see.

  'Ask me no reason why I love you; for though Love use Reason
   for his precisian, he admits him not for his counsellor. You
   are not young, no more am I; go to, then, there's sympathy:
   you are merry, so am I; ha! ha! then there's more sympathy;
   you love sack, and so do I; would you desire better sympathy?
   Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page, at the least, if the love
   of soldier can suffice, that I love thee. I will not say,
   pity me: 'tis not a soldier-like phrase; but I say, Love me.
   By me,
      Thine own true knight,
      By day or night,
      Or any kind of light,
      With all his might,
      For thee to fight,
                                   JOHN Falstaff'

What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked, wicked world! One that is
well-nigh worn to pieces with age to show himself a young gallant.
What an unweighed behaviour hath this Flemish drunkard picked, with
the devil's name! out of my conversation, that he dares in this manner
assay me? Why, he hath not been thrice in my company! What should I
say to him? I was then frugal of my mirth:--Heaven forgive me! Why,
I'll exhibit a bill in the parliament for the putting down of men.
How shall I be revenged on him? for revenged I will be, as sure as
his guts are made of puddings.


@d{}
[Enter MISTRESS Ford]


@e{"names":["Mistress Ford"]}

@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Mistress Page! trust me, I was going to your house.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

And, trust me, I was coming to you. You look very ill.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Nay, I'll ne'er believe that; I have to show to the contrary.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Faith, but you do, in my mind.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Well, I do, then; yet, I say, I could show you to the contrary.
O, Mistress Page! give me some counsel.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

What's the matter, woman?


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

O woman, if it were not for one trifling respect, I could come to
such honour!


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Hang the trifle, woman; take the honour. What is it?--Dispense with
trifles;--what is it?


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so, I could be
knighted.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

What? thou liest. Sir Alice Ford! These knights will hack; and so
thou shouldst not alter the article of thy gentry.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

We burn daylight: here, read, read; perceive how I might be knighted.
I shall think the worse of fat men as long as I have an eye to make
difference of men's liking: and yet he would not swear; praised
women's modesty; and gave such orderly and well-behaved reproof to
all uncomeliness that I would have sworn his disposition would have
gone to the truth of his words; but they do no more adhere and keep
place together than the Hundredth Psalm to the tune of 'Greensleeves.'
What tempest, I trow, threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in
his belly, ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged on him? I think
the best way were to entertain him with hope, till the wicked fire of
lust have melted him in his own grease. Did you ever hear the like?


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Letter for letter, but that the name of Page and Ford differs. To thy
great comfort in this mystery of ill opinions, here's the twin-brother
of thy letter; but let thine inherit first, for, I protest, mine never
shall. I warrant he hath a thousand of these letters, writ with blank
space for different names, sure, more, and these are of the second
edition. He will print them, out of doubt; for he cares not what he
puts into the press, when he would put us two: I had rather be a
giantess and lie under Mount Pelion. Well, I will find you twenty
lascivious turtles ere one chaste man.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Why, this is the very same; the very hand, the very words. What doth
he think of us?


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Nay, I know not; it makes me almost ready to wrangle with mine own
honesty. I'll entertain myself like one that I am not acquainted
withal; for, sure, unless he know some strain in me that I know not
myself, he would never have boarded me in this fury.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

'Boarding' call you it? I'll be sure to keep him above deck.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

So will I; if he come under my hatches, I'll never to sea again.
Let's be revenged on him; let's appoint him a meeting, give him a
show of comfort in his suit, and lead him on with a fine-baited
delay, till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Nay, I will consent to act any villainy against him that may not
sully the chariness of our honesty. O, that my husband saw this
letter! It would give eternal food to his jealousy.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Why, look where he comes; and my good man too: he's as far from
jealousy as I am from giving him cause; and that, I hope, is an
unmeasurable distance.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

You are the happier woman.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Let's consult together against this greasy knight. Come hither.


@d{}

[Enter FORD, PISTOL, and PAGE and Nym]


@e{"names":["Ford","Pistol","Page","Nym"]}

@l{"name":"Ford"}

Well, I hope it be not so.


@l{"name":"Pistol"}

Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs:
Sir John affects thy wife.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Why, sir, my wife is not young.


@l{"name":"Pistol"}

He woos both high and low, both rich and poor,
Both young and old, one with another, Ford;
He loves the gallimaufry. Ford, perpend.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Love my wife!


@l{"name":"Pistol"}

With liver burning hot: prevent, or go thou,
Like Sir Actaeon he, with Ringwood at thy heels.--
O! odious is the name!


@l{"name":"Ford"}

What name, sir?


@l{"name":"Pistol"}

The horn, I say. Farewell:
Take heed; have open eye, for thieves do foot by night;
Take heed, ere summer comes, or cuckoo birds do sing.
Away, Sir Corporal Nym.
Believe it, Page; he speaks sense.

@l{"name":"Ford"}
I will be patient: I will find out this.

@l{"name":"Nym"}
And this is true; I like not the humour of lying. He hath
wronged me in some humours: I should have borne the humoured letter
to her; but I have a sword, and it shall bite upon my necessity. He
loves your wife; there's the short and the long. My name is Corporal
Nym; I speak, and I avouch 'tis true. My name is Nym, and Falstaff
loves your wife. Adieu. I love not the humour of bread and cheese;
and there's the humour of it. Adieu.

I will seek out Falstaff.


@l{"name":"Page"}

I never heard such a drawling, affecting rogue.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

If I do find it: well.


@l{"name":"Page"}

I will not believe such a Cataian, though the priest o' the town
commended him for a true man.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

'Twas a good sensible fellow: well.


@l{"name":"Page"}

How now, Meg!


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Whither go you, George?--Hark you.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

How now, sweet Frank! why art thou melancholy?


@l{"name":"Ford"}

I melancholy! I am not melancholy. Get you home, go.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Faith, thou hast some crotchets in thy head now. Will you go,
Mistress Page?


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Have with you. You'll come to dinner, George?

@x{"names":["Mistress Quickly", "Mistress Page", "Mistress Ford"]}

@l{"name":"Page"}

How now, Master Ford!


@l{"name":"Ford"}

You heard what this knave told me, did you not?


@l{"name":"Page"}

Yes; and you heard what the other told me?


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Do you think there is truth in them?


@l{"name":"Page"}

Hang 'em, slaves! I do not think the knight would offer it; but these
that accuse him in his intent towards our wives are a yoke of his
discarded men; very rogues, now they be out of service.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Were they his men?


@l{"name":"Page"}

Marry, were they.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

I like it never the better for that. Does he lie at the Garter?


@l{"name":"Page"}

Ay, marry, does he. If he should intend this voyage toward my wife,
I would turn her loose to him; and what he gets more of her than
sharp words, let it lie on my head.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

I do not misdoubt my wife; but I would be loath to turn them together.
A man may be too confident. I would have nothing 'lie on my head': I
cannot be thus satisfied.


@l{"name":"Page"}

Look where my ranting host of the Garter comes. There is either
liquor in his pate or money in his purse when he looks so merrily. 


@d{}

@e{"names":["Host","Shallow"]}

How now, mine host!


@l{"name":"Host"}

How now, bully-rook! Thou'rt a gentleman. Cavaliero-justice, I say!


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

I follow, mine host, I follow. Good even and twenty, good Master
Page! Master Page, will you go with us? We have sport in hand.


@l{"name":"Host"}

Tell him, cavaliero-justice; tell him, bully-rook.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

Sir, there is a fray to be fought between Sir Hugh the Welsh priest
and Caius the French doctor.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Good mine host o' the Garter, a word with you.


@l{"name":"Host"}

What say'st thou, my bully-rook?


@d{}
[They go aside.]


@d{}
[To Page] 
@l{"name":"Shallow"}
Will you go with us to behold it? My merry host hath had
the measuring of their weapons; and, I think, hath appointed them
contrary places; for, believe me, I hear the parson is no jester.
Hark, I will tell you what our sport shall be. 
@d{}
[They converse apart.]


@l{"name":"Host"}

Hast thou no suit against my knight, my guest-cavaliero?


@l{"name":"Ford"}

None, I protest: but I'll give you a pottle of burnt sack to give me
recourse to him, and tell him my name is Brook, only for a jest.


@l{"name":"Host"}

My hand, bully; thou shalt have egress and regress; said I well? and
thy name shall be Brook. It is a merry knight. Will you go, mynheers?


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

Have with you, mine host.


@l{"name":"Page"}

I have heard the Frenchman hath good skill in his rapier.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

Tut, sir! I could have told you more. In these times you stand on
distance, your passes, stoccadoes, and I know not what: 'tis the
heart, Master Page; 'tis here, 'tis here. I have seen the time with
my long sword I would have made you four tall fellows skip like rats.


@l{"name":"Host"}

Here, boys, here, here! Shall we wag?


@l{"name":"Page"}

Have with you. I had rather hear them scold than fight.

Though Page be a secure fool, and stands so firmly on his wife's
frailty, yet I cannot put off my opinion so easily. She was in his
company at Page's house, and what they made there I know not. Well,
I will look further into 't; and I have a disguise to sound Falstaff.
If I find her honest, I lose not my labour; if she be otherwise,

[Enter FALSTAFF and Pistol]


@e{"names":["Falstaff","Pistol"]}

@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

I will not lend thee a penny.


@l{"name":"Pistol"}

Why then, the world's mine oyster,
Which I with sword will open.
I will retort the sum in equipage.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Not a penny. I have been content, sir, you should lay my countenance
to pawn; I have grated upon my good friends for three reprieves for
you and your coach-fellow, Nym; or else you had looked through the
grate, like a geminy of baboons. I am damned in hell for swearing
to gentlemen my friends you were good soldiers and tall fellows; and
when Mistress Bridget lost the handle of her fan, I took 't upon
mine honour thou hadst it not.


@l{"name":"Pistol"}

Didst not thou share? Hadst thou not fifteen pence?


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Reason, you rogue, reason. Thinkest thou I'll endanger my soul
gratis? At a word, hang no more about me, I am no gibbet for you:
go: a short knife and a throng!--to your manor of Picht-hatch! go.
You'll not bear a letter for me, you rogue!--you stand upon your
honour!--Why, thou unconfinable baseness, it is as much as I can do
to keep the terms of my honour precise. I, I, I myself sometimes,
leaving the fear of God on the left hand, and hiding mine honour in
my necessity, am fain to shuffle, to hedge, and to lurch; and yet
you, rogue, will ensconce your rags, your cat-a-mountain looks,
your red-lattice phrases, and your bold-beating oaths, under the
shelter of your honour! You will not do it, you!

I do relent; what wouldst thou more of man?

@e{"names":["Mistress Quickly"]}

@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Give your worship good morrow.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Good morrow, good wife.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Not so, an't please your worship.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Good maid, then.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

I'll be sworn; As my mother was, the first hour I was born.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

I do believe the swearer. What with me?


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Shall I vouchsafe your worship a word or two?


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Two thousand, fair woman; and I'll vouchsafe thee the hearing.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

There is one Mistress Ford, sir,--I pray, come a little nearer this
ways:--I myself dwell with Master Doctor Caius.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Well, on: Mistress Ford, you say,--


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Your worship says very true;--I pray your worship come a little
nearer this ways.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

I warrant thee nobody hears--mine own people, mine own people.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Are they so? God bless them, and make them His servants!


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Well: Mistress Ford, what of her?


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Why, sir, she's a good creature. Lord, Lord! your worship's a wanton!
Well, heaven forgive you, and all of us, I pray.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Mistress Ford; come, Mistress Ford--


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Marry, this is the short and the long of it. You have brought her
into such a canaries as 'tis wonderful: the best courtier of them
all, when the court lay at Windsor, could never have brought her to
such a canary; yet there has been knights, and lords, and gentlemen,
with their coaches; I warrant you, coach after coach, letter after
letter, gift after gift; smelling so sweetly,--all musk, and so
rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold; and in such alligant
terms; and in such wine and sugar of the best and the fairest, that
would have won any woman's heart; and I warrant you, they could
never get an eye-wink of her. I had myself twenty angels given me
this morning; but I defy all angels, in any such sort, as they say,
but in the way of honesty: and, I warrant you, they could never get
her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of them all; and yet
there has been earls, nay, which is more, pensioners; but, I warrant
you, all is one with her.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

But what says she to me? be brief, my good she-Mercury.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Marry, she hath received your letter; for the which she thanks you
a thousand times; and she gives you to notify that her husband will
be absence from his house between ten and eleven.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Ten and eleven?


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see the picture, she says,
that you wot of: Master Ford, her husband, will be from home. Alas!
the sweet woman leads an ill life with him; he's a very jealousy
man; she leads a very frampold life with him, good heart.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her; I will not fail her.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Why, you say well. But I have another messenger to your worship:
Mistress Page hath her hearty commendations to you too; and let me
tell you in your ear, she's as fartuous a civil modest wife, and
one, I tell you, that will not miss you morning nor evening prayer,
as any is in Windsor, whoe'er be the other; and she bade me tell
your worship that her husband is seldom from home, but she hopes
there will come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upon a man:
surely I think you have charms, la! yes, in truth.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Not I, I assure thee; setting the attraction of my good parts aside,
I have no other charms.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Blessing on your heart for 't!


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

But, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford's wife and Page's wife
acquainted each other how they love me?


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

That were a jest indeed! They have not so little grace, I hope: that
were a trick indeed! But Mistress Page would desire you to send
her your little page, of all loves: her husband has a marvellous
infection to the little page; and, truly, Master Page is an honest
man. Never a wife in Windsor leads a better life than she does; do
what she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go to bed when
she list, rise when she list, all is as she will; and truly she
deserves it; for if there be a kind woman in Windsor, she is one.
You must send her your page; no remedy.

Why, I will.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Nay, but do so then; and, look you, he may come and go between
you both; and in any case have a nay-word, that you may know one
another's mind, and the boy never need to understand any thing; for
'tis not good that children should know any wickedness: old folks,
you know, have discretion, as they say, and know the world.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Fare thee well; commend me to them both. There's my purse; I am yet
thy debtor. Boy, go along with this woman.--

You're welcome. What's your will?--Give us leave, drawer.

@x{"names":["Bardolph"]}

@l{"name":"Ford"}

Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent much: my name is Brook.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Good Sir John, I sue for yours: not to charge you; for I must let
you understand I think myself in better plight for a lender than
you are: the which hath something embold'ned me to this unseasoned
intrusion; for they say, if money go before, all ways do lie open.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Troth, and I have a bag of money here troubles me; if you will
help to bear it, Sir John, take all, or half, for easing me of
the carriage.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

I will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Speak, good Master Brook; I shall be glad to be your servant.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Sir, I hear you are a scholar,--I will be brief with you, and
you have been a man long known to me, though I had never so good
means, as desire, to make myself acquainted with you. I shall
discover a thing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mine
own imperfection; but, good Sir John, as you have one eye upon my
follies, as you hear them unfolded, turn another into the register
of your own, that I may pass with a reproof the easier, sith you
yourself know how easy is it to be such an offender.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Very well, sir; proceed.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

There is a gentlewoman in this town, her husband's name is Ford.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Well, sir.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

I have long loved her, and, I protest to you, bestowed much on her;
followed her with a doting observance; engrossed opportunities to
meet her; fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly
give me sight of her; not only bought many presents to give her,
but have given largely to many to know what she would have given;
briefly, I have pursued her as love hath pursued me; which hath
been on the wing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have merited,
either in my mind or in my means, meed, I am sure, I have received
none, unless experience be a jewel that I have purchased at an
infinite rate, and that hath taught me to say this,

Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues;
Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands?


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Never.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Have you importuned her to such a purpose?


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Never.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Of what quality was your love, then?


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Like a fair house built on another man's ground; so that I have
lost my edifice by mistaking the place where I erected it.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?


@l{"name":"Ford"}

When I have told you that, I have told you all. Some say that though
she appear honest to me, yet in other places she enlargeth her mirth
so far that there is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir John,
here is the heart of my purpose: you are a gentleman of excellent
breeding, admirable discourse, of great admittance, authentic in
your place and person, generally allowed for your many war-like,
court-like, and learned preparations.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

O, sir!


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Believe it, for you know it. There is money; spend it, spend it;
spend more; spend all I have; only give me so much of your time in
exchange of it as to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this
Ford's wife: use your art of wooing, win her to consent to you;
if any man may, you may as soon as any.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Would it apply well to the vehemency of your affection, that I
should win what you would enjoy? Methinks you prescribe to yourself
very preposterously.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on the excellency
of her honour that the folly of my soul dares not present itself;
she is too bright to be looked against. Now, could I come to her
with any detection in my hand, my desires had instance and argument
to commend themselves; I could drive her then from the ward of her
purity, her reputation, her marriage-vow, and a thousand other her
defences, which now are too too strongly embattled against me.
What say you to't, Sir John?


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Master Brook, I will first make bold with your money; next, give me
your hand; and last, as I am a gentleman, you shall, if you will,
enjoy Ford's wife.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

O good sir!


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

I say you shall.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Want no money, Sir John; you shall want none.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall want none. I shall
be with her, I may tell you, by her own appointment; even as you
came in to me her assistant or go-between parted from me: I say
I shall be with her between ten and eleven; for at that time the
jealous rascally knave, her husband, will be forth. Come you to
me at night; you shall know how I speed.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford, sir?


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him not; yet I wrong him to
call him poor; they say the jealous wittolly knave hath masses of
money; for the which his wife seems to me well-favoured. I will
use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue's coffer; and there's my
harvest-home.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him if you saw him.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will stare him out of his
wits; I will awe him with my cudgel; it shall hang like a meteor
o'er the cuckold's horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I will
predominate over the peasant, and thou shalt lie with his wife.
Come to me soon at night. Ford's a knave, and I will aggravate his
style; thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave and cuckold.
Come to me soon at night. 


@d{}

@x{"names":["Falstaff"]}

@l{"name":"Ford"}

What a damned Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is ready to crack
with impatience. Who says this is improvident jealousy? My wife hath
sent to him; the hour is fixed; the match is made. Would any man
have thought this? See the hell of having a false woman! My bed
shall be abused, my coffers ransacked, my reputation gnawn at; and
I shall not only receive this villanous wrong, but stand under the
adoption of abominable terms, and by him that does me this wrong.
Terms! names! Amaimon sounds well; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well;
yet they are devils' additions, the names of fiends. But Cuckold!
Wittol!--Cuckold! the devil himself hath not such a name. Page is
an ass, a secure ass; he will trust his wife; he will not be
jealous; I will rather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh
the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my aqua-vitae bottle,
or a thief to walk my ambling gelding, than my wife with herself;
then she plots, then she ruminates, then she devises; and what
they think in their hearts they may effect, they will break their
hearts but they will effect. God be praised for my jealousy!
Eleven o'clock the hour. I will prevent this, detect my wife, be
revenged on Falstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it; better
three hours too soon than a minute too late. Fie, fie, fie!
cuckold! cuckold! cuckold!

her folly motion and advantage; and now she's going to my wife,

the wind: and Falstaff's boy with her! Good plots! They are laid;
and our revolted wives share damnation together. Well; I will take

Not by my consent, I promise you. The gentleman is of no having:
he kept company with the wild Prince and Pointz; he is of too high

Master Doctor, you shall go; so shall you, Master Page; and you,

Well, fare you well; we shall have the freer wooing at Master Page's.

@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

What, John! what, Robert!


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Quickly, quickly:--Is the buck-basket--


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

I warrant. What, Robin, I say!


@d{}
[Enter SERVANTS with a basket.]


@e{"names":["First Servant","Second Servant"]}

@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Come, come, come.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Here, set it down.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Give your men the charge; we must be brief.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Marry, as I told you before, John and Robert, be ready here hard by
in the brew-house; and when I suddenly call you, come forth, and,
without any pause or staggering, take this basket on your shoulders:
that done, trudge with it in all haste, and carry it among the
whitsters in Datchet-Mead, and there empty it in the muddy ditch
close by the Thames side.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

You will do it?


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

I have told them over and over; they lack no direction. Be gone, and
come when you are called.

Here comes little Robin.

@e{"names":["Robin"]}

@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

How now, my eyas-musket! what news with you?


@l{"name":"Robin"}

My Master Sir John is come in at your back-door, Mistress Ford,
and requests your company.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

You little Jack-a-Lent, have you been true to us?


@l{"name":"Robin"}

Ay, I'll be sworn. My master knows not of your being here, and hath
threatened to put me into everlasting liberty, if I tell you of it;
for he swears he'll turn me away.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Thou 'rt a good boy; this secrecy of thine shall be a tailor to
thee, and shall make thee a new doublet and hose. I'll go hide me.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Do so. Go tell thy master I am alone.


@d{}
[Exit Robin]


@x{"names":["Robin"]}

@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}
Mistress Page, remember you your cue.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

I warrant thee; if I do not act it, hiss me.


@d{}
[Exit.]

@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Go to, then; we'll use this unwholesome humidity, this gross watery
pumpion; we'll teach him to know turtles from jays.


@d{}
[Enter Falstaff]


@e{"names":["Falstaff"]}

@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

'Have I caught thee, my heavenly jewel?' Why, now let me die, for
I have lived long enough: this is the period of my ambition:
O this blessed hour!


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

O, sweet Sir John!


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Mistress Ford, I cannot cog, I cannot prate, Mistress Ford. Now
shall I sin in my wish; I would thy husband were dead. I'll speak
it before the best lord, I would make thee my lady.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

I your lady, Sir John! Alas, I should be a pitiful
lady.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Let the court of France show me such another. I see how thine eye
would emulate the diamond; thou hast the right arched beauty of
the brow that becomes the ship-tire, the tire-valiant, or any tire
of Venetian admittance.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

A plain kerchief, Sir John; my brows become nothing else; nor that
well neither.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

By the Lord, thou art a traitor to say so: thou wouldst make an
absolute courtier; and the firm fixture of thy foot would give an
excellent motion to thy gait in a semi-circled farthingale. I see
what thou wert, if Fortune thy foe were not, Nature thy friend.
Come, thou canst not hide it.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Believe me, there's no such thing in me.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

What made me love thee? Let that persuade thee there's something
extraordinary in thee. Come, I cannot cog and say thou art this
and that, like a many of these lisping hawthorn-buds that come
like women in men's apparel, and smell like Bucklersbury in
simple-time; I cannot; but I love thee, none but thee; and thou
deservest it.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Do not betray me, sir; I fear you love Mistress Page.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by the Counter-gate, which
is as hateful to me as the reek of a lime-kiln.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Well, heaven knows how I love you; and you shall one day find it.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Keep in that mind; I'll deserve it.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Nay, I must tell you, so you do; or else I could not be in that mind.


@d{}
[Within] 
@l{"name":"Robin"}
Mistress Ford! Mistress Ford! here's Mistress Page at the
door, sweating and blowing and looking wildly, and would needs speak
with you presently.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

She shall not see me; I will ensconce me behind the arras.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Pray you, do so; she's a very tattling woman.


@d{}
[FALSTAFF hides himself.]

[Re-enter MISTRESS PAGE and Robin]


@e{"names":["Mistress Page","Robin"]}

@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}
What's the matter? How now!


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

O Mistress Ford, what have you done? You're shamed, you are
overthrown, you are undone for ever!


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

What's the matter, good Mistress Page?


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

O well-a-day, Mistress Ford! having an honest man to your husband,
to give him such cause of suspicion!


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

What cause of suspicion?


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

What cause of suspicion? Out upon you! how am I mistook in you!


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Why, alas, what's the matter?


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Your husband's coming hither, woman, with all the officers in
Windsor, to search for a gentleman that he says is here now in
the house, by your consent, to take an ill advantage of his absence:
you are undone.


@d{}
[Aside.] 
@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}
Speak louder.--
'Tis not so, I hope.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Pray heaven it be not so that you have such a man here! but 'tis
most certain your husband's coming, with half Windsor at his heels,
to search for such a one. I come before to tell you. If you know
yourself clear, why, I am glad of it; but if you have a friend here,
convey, convey him out. Be not amazed; call all your senses to you;
defend your reputation, or bid farewell to your good life for ever.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

What shall I do?--There is a gentleman, my dear friend; and I fear
not mine own shame as much as his peril: I had rather than a
thousand pound he were out of the house.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

For shame! never stand 'you had rather' and 'you had rather': your
husband's here at hand; bethink you of some conveyance; in the
house you cannot hide him. O, how have you deceived me! Look, here
is a basket; if he be of any reasonable stature, he may creep in
here; and throw foul linen upon him, as if it were going to
bucking: or--it is whiting-time--send him by your two men to
Datchet-Mead.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

He's too big to go in there. What shall I do?


@d{}
[Coming forward] 
@l{"name":"Falstaff"}
Let me see 't, let me see 't. O, let me see 't!
I'll in, I'll in; follow your friend's counsel; I'll in.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

What, Sir John Falstaff! Are these your letters, knight?


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

I love thee and none but thee; help me away: let me creep in here.
I'll never--


@d{}
[He gets into the basket; they cover him with foul linen.]


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Help to cover your master, boy. Call your men, Mistress Ford. You
dissembling knight!

What, John! Robert! John!

@l{"name":"Ford"}

Pray you come near. If I suspect without cause, why then make sport
at me, then let me be your jest; I deserve it. How now, whither
bear you this?


@l{"name":"Servant"}

To the laundress, forsooth.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Why, what have you to do whither they bear it? You were best meddle
with buck-washing.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Buck! I would I could wash myself of the buck! Buck, buck, buck!
ay, buck; I warrant you, buck; and of the season too, it shall appear.

Gentlemen, I have dreamed to-night; I'll tell you my dream. Here,

I'll warrant we'll unkennel the fox. Let me stop this way first.

@d{}
[Locking the door.] 
@l{"name":"Ford"}
So, now uncape.


@l{"name":"Page"}

Good Master Ford, be contented: you wrong yourself

True, Master Page. Up, gentlemen, you shall see sport anon; follow
me, gentlemen.

This is fery fantastical humours and jealousies.

Nay, follow him, gentlemen; see the issue of his search.


@d{}
[Exeunt EVANS, PAGE, and Doctor Caius]


@x{"names":["Evans","Page","Doctor Caius"]}

@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Is there not a double excellency in this?


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

I know not which pleases me better, that my husband is deceived, or
Sir John.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

What a taking was he in when your husband asked who was in the basket!


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

I am half afraid he will have need of washing; so throwing him into
the water will do him a benefit.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Hang him, dishonest rascal! I would all of the same strain were in
the same distress.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

I think my husband hath some special suspicion of Falstaff's being
here, for I never saw him so gross in his jealousy till now.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

I will lay a plot to try that, and we will yet have more tricks
with Falstaff: his dissolute disease will scarce obey this medicine.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Shall we send that foolish carrion, Mistress Quickly, to him, and
excuse his throwing into the water, and give him another hope, to
betray him to another punishment?


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

We will do it; let him be sent for to-morrow eight o'clock, to
have amends.


@d{}

Amen!

You do yourself mighty wrong, Master Ford.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Ay, ay; I must bear it.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

If there be any pody in the house, and in the chambers, and in the
coffers, and in the presses, heaven forgive my sins at the day of
judgment!


@l{"name":"Doctor Caius"}

Be gar, nor I too; there is no bodies.


@l{"name":"Page"}

Fie, fie, Master Ford, are you not ashamed? What spirit, what devil
suggests this imagination? I would not ha' your distemper in this
kind for the wealth of Windsor Castle.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

'Tis my fault, Master Page: I suffer for it.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

You suffer for a pad conscience. Your wife is as honest a 'omans as
I will desires among five thousand, and five hundred too.


@l{"name":"Doctor Caius"}

By gar, I see 'tis an honest woman.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Well, I promised you a dinner. Come, come, walk in the Park: I pray
you pardon me; I will hereafter make known to you why I have done
this. Come, wife, come, Mistress Page; I pray you pardon me; pray
heartily, pardon me.


@l{"name":"Page"}

Let's go in, gentlemen; but, trust me, we'll mock him. I do invite
you to-morrow morning to my house to breakfast; after, we'll
a-birding together; I have a fine hawk for the bush. Shall it be so?


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Any thing.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

If there is one, I shall make two in the company.


@l{"name":"Doctor Caius"}

If there be one or two, I shall make-a the turd.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Pray you go, Master Page.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

I pray you now, remembrance to-morrow on the lousy knave, mine host.

I see I cannot get thy father's love;
Therefore no more turn me to him, sweet Nan.


@l{"name":"Anne"}

Alas! how then?


@l{"name":"Fenton"}

Why, thou must be thyself.
He doth object, I am too great of birth;
And that my state being gall'd with my expense,
I seek to heal it only by his wealth.
Besides these, other bars he lays before me,
My riots past, my wild societies;
And tells me 'tis a thing impossible
I should love thee but as a property.


@l{"name":"Anne"}

May be he tells you true.


@l{"name":"Fenton"}

No, heaven so speed me in my time to come!
Albeit I will confess thy father's wealth
Was the first motive that I wooed thee, Anne:
Yet, wooing thee, I found thee of more value
Than stamps in gold, or sums in sealed bags;
And 'tis the very riches of thyself
That now I aim at.


@l{"name":"Anne"}

Gentle Master Fenton,
Yet seek my father's love; still seek it, sir.
If opportunity and humblest suit
Cannot attain it, why then,--hark you hither.

Be not dismayed.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

No, she shall not dismay me. I care not for that, but that I am afeard.

Hark ye; Master Slender would speak a word with you.


@l{"name":"Anne"}

I come to him.

O, what a world of vile ill-favour'd faults
Looks handsome in three hundred pounds a year!


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

And how does good Master Fenton? Pray you, a
word with you.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

She's coming; to her, coz. O boy, thou hadst a father!


@l{"name":"Slender"}

I had a father, Mistress Anne; my uncle can tell you good jests
of him. Pray you, uncle, tell Mistress Anne the jest how my father
stole two geese out of a pen, good uncle.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

Mistress Anne, my cousin loves you.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

Ay, that I do; as well as I love any woman in Gloucestershire.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

He will maintain you like a gentlewoman.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

Ay, that I will come cut and long-tail, under the degree of a squire.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

He will make you a hundred and fifty pounds jointure.


@l{"name":"Anne"}

Good Master Shallow, let him woo for himself.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

Marry, I thank you for it; I thank you for that good comfort. She
calls you, coz; I'll leave you.


@l{"name":"Anne"}

Now, Master Slender.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

Now, good Mistress Anne.--


@l{"name":"Anne"}

What is your will?


@l{"name":"Slender"}

My will! 'od's heartlings, that's a pretty jest indeed! I ne'er
made my will yet, I thank heaven; I am not such a sickly creature,
I give heaven praise.


@l{"name":"Anne"}

I mean, Master Slender, what would you with me?


@l{"name":"Slender"}

Truly, for mine own part I would little or nothing with you. Your
father and my uncle hath made motions; if it be my luck, so; if not,
happy man be his dole! They can tell you how things go better than
I can. You may ask your father; here he comes.

Nay, Master Page, be not impatient.

In such a righteous fashion as I do,
Perforce, against all checks, rebukes, and manners,
I must advance the colours of my love
And not retire: let me have your good will.


@l{"name":"Anne"}

Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

I mean it not; I seek you a better husband.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

That's my master, Master doctor.


@l{"name":"Anne"}

Alas! I had rather be set quick i' the earth.
And bowl'd to death with turnips.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Come, trouble not yourself. Good Master Fenton,
I will not be your friend, nor enemy;
My daughter will I question how she loves you,
And as I find her, so am I affected.
Till then, farewell, sir: she must needs go in;
Her father will be angry.

Farewell, gentle mistress. Farewell, Nan.

@x{"names":["Bardolph"]}

@l{"name":"Falstaff"}
Have I lived to be carried in a basket, and to be thrown in the
Thames like a barrow of butcher's offal? Well, if I be served such
another trick, I'll have my brains ta'en out and buttered, and give
them to a dog for a new year's gift. The rogues slighted me into
the river with as little remorse as they would have drowned a blind
bitch's puppies, fifteen i' the litter; and you may know by my size
that I have a kind of alacrity in sinking; if the bottom were as
deep as hell I should down. I had been drowned but that the shore
was shelvy and shallow; a death that I abhor, for the water swells
a man; and what a thing should I have been when had been swelled!
I should have been a mountain of mummy.

@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Marry, sir, I come to your worship from Mistress Ford.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Mistress Ford! I have had ford enough; I was thrown into the ford;
I have my belly full of ford.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Alas the day! good heart, that was not her fault: she does so take
on with her men; they mistook their erection.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

So did I mine, to build upon a foolish woman's promise.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Well, she laments, sir, for it, that it would yearn your heart to
see it. Her husband goes this morning a-birding; she desires you
once more to come to her between eight and nine; I must carry her
word quickly. She'll make you amends, I warrant you.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Well, I will visit her. Tell her so; and bid her think what a man
is; let her consider his frailty, and then judge of my merit.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

I will tell her.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Do so. Between nine and ten, sayest thou?


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Eight and nine, sir.

Well, be gone; I will not miss her.

Now, Master Brook, you come to know what hath passed between me
and Ford's wife?


@l{"name":"Ford"}

That, indeed, Sir John, is my business.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Master Brook, I will not lie to you: I was at her house the hour
she appointed me.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

And how sped you, sir?


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Very ill-favouredly, Master Brook.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

How so, sir? did she change her determination?


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

No. Master Brook; but the peaking cornuto her husband, Master Brook,
dwelling in a continual 'larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant
of our encounter, after we had embraced, kissed, protested, and, as
it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy; and at his heels a
rabble of his companions, thither provoked and instigated by his
distemper, and, forsooth, to search his house for his wife's love.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

What! while you were there?


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

While I was there.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

And did he search for you, and could not find you?


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes in one Mistress
Page; gives intelligence of Ford's approach; and, in her invention
and Ford's wife's distraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

A buck-basket!


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

By the Lord, a buck-basket! rammed me in with foul shirts and
smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy napkins, that, Master Brook,
there was the rankest compound of villainous smell that ever
offended nostril.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

And how long lay you there?


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have suffered to bring
this woman to evil for your good. Being thus crammed in the basket,
a couple of Ford's knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their
mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to Datchet-lane;
they took me on their shoulders; met the jealous knave their
master in the door; who asked them once or twice what they had in
their basket. I quaked for fear lest the lunatic knave would have
searched it; but Fate, ordaining he should be a cuckold, held his
hand. Well, on went he for a search, and away went I for foul
clothes. But mark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs
of three several deaths: first, an intolerable fright to be
detected with a jealous rotten bell-wether; next, to be compassed
like a good bilbo in the circumference of a peck, hilt to
point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in, like a strong
distillation, with stinking clothes that fretted in their own
grease: think of that; a man of my kidney, think of that, that am
as subject to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution and
thaw: it was a miracle to 'scape suffocation. And in the height
of this bath, when I was more than half stewed in grease, like
a Dutch dish, to be thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing
hot, in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of that, hissing hot,
think of that, Master Brook!


@l{"name":"Ford"}

In good sadness, sir, I am sorry that for my sake you have suffered
all this. My suit, then, is desperate; you'll undertake her no more.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have been into
Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her husband is this morning
gone a-birding; I have received from her another embassy of
meeting; 'twixt eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

'Tis past eight already, sir.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Is it? I will then address me to my appointment. Come to me at
your convenient leisure, and you shall know how I speed, and the
conclusion shall be crowned with your enjoying her: adieu. You
shall have her, Master Brook; Master Brook, you shall cuckold Ford.

@l{"name":"Ford"}

Hum! ha! Is this a vision? Is this a dream? Do I sleep? Master Ford,
awake; awake, Master Ford. There's a hole made in your best coat,
Master Ford. This 'tis to be married; this 'tis to have linen and
buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself what I am; I will now
take the lecher; he is at my house. He cannot scape me; 'tis
impossible he should; he cannot creep into a half-penny purse, nor
into a pepper box; but, lest the devil that guides him should aid
him, I will search impossible places. Though what I am I cannot
avoid, yet to be what I would not, shall not make me tame; if I
have horns to make one mad, let the proverb go with me; I'll be
horn-mad.

@e{"names":["Mistress Page","Mistress Quickly","William"]}

@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Is he at Master Ford's already, think'st thou?


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Sure he is by this; or will be presently; but truly he is very
courageous mad about his throwing into the water. Mistress Ford
desires you to come suddenly.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

I'll be with her by and by; I'll but bring my young man here to

[Enter SIR HUGH Evans]


@e{"names":["Evans"]}

@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}
How now, Sir Hugh, no school to-day?


@l{"name":"Evans"}

No; Master Slender is let the boys leave to play.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Blessing of his heart!


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Sir Hugh, my husband says my son profits nothing in the world at
his book; I pray you ask him some questions in his accidence.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

Come hither, William; hold up your head; come.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Come on, sirrah; hold up your head; answer your master; be not afraid.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

William, how many numbers is in nouns?


@l{"name":"William"}

Two.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Truly, I thought there had been one number more, because they say
'Od's nouns.'


@l{"name":"Evans"}

Peace your tattlings! What is 'fair,' William?


@l{"name":"William"}

Pulcher.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Polecats! There are fairer things than polecats, sure.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

You are a very simplicity 'oman; I pray you, peace. What is
'lapis,' William?


@l{"name":"William"}

A stone.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

And what is 'a stone,' William?


@l{"name":"William"}

A pebble.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

No, it is 'lapis'; I pray you remember in your prain.


@l{"name":"William"}

Lapis.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

That is a good William. What is he, William, that does lend articles?


@l{"name":"William"}

Articles are borrowed of the pronoun, and be thus declined:
Singulariter, nominativo; hic, haec, hoc.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

Nominativo, hig, hag, hog; pray you, mark: genitivo, hujus. Well,
what is your accusative case?


@l{"name":"William"}

Accusativo, hinc.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

I pray you, have your remembrance, child. Accusativo, hung, hang, hog.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

'Hang-hog' is Latin for bacon, I warrant you.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

Leave your prabbles, 'oman. What is the focative case, William?


@l{"name":"William"}

O vocativo, O.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

Remember, William: focative is caret.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

And that's a good root.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

'Oman, forbear.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Peace.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

What is your genitive case plural, William?


@l{"name":"William"}

Genitive case?


@l{"name":"Evans"}

Ay.


@l{"name":"William"}

Genitive: horum, harum, horum.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Vengeance of Jenny's case; fie on her! Never name her, child, if
she be a whore.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

For shame, 'oman.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

You do ill to teach the child such words. He teaches him to hick
and to hack, which they'll do fast enough of themselves; and to
call 'horum;' fie upon you!


@l{"name":"Evans"}

'Oman, art thou lunatics? Hast thou no understandings for thy cases,
and the numbers of the genders? Thou art as foolish Christian
creatures as I would desires.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Prithee, hold thy peace.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

Show me now, William, some declensions of your pronouns.


@l{"name":"William"}

Forsooth, I have forgot.

[Enter FALSTAFF and MISTRESS Ford]


@e{"names":["Falstaff","Mistress Ford"]}

@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Mistress Ford, your sorrow hath eaten up my sufferance. I see you
are obsequious in your love, and I profess requital to a hair's
breadth; not only, Mistress Ford, in the simple office of love,
but in all the accoutrement, complement, and ceremony of it. But
are you sure of your husband now?


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

He's a-birding, sweet Sir John.


@d{}

@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}
What ho! gossip Ford, what ho!


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Step into the chamber, Sir John.

@e{"names":["Mistress Page"]}

@x{"names":["Falstaff"]}

@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

How now, sweetheart! who's at home besides yourself?


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Why, none but mine own people.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Indeed!


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

No, certainly.--
@d{}
[Aside to her.] 
@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}
Speak louder.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Truly, I am so glad you have nobody here.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Why?


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Why, woman, your husband is in his old lunes again. He so takes
on yonder with my husband; so rails against all married mankind;
so curses all Eve's daughters, of what complexion soever; and so
buffets himself on the forehead, crying 'Peer out, peer out!'
that any madness I ever yet beheld seemed but tameness, civility,
and patience, to this his distemper he is in now. I am glad the
fat knight is not here.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Why, does he talk of him?


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Of none but him; and swears he was carried out, the last time he
searched for him, in a basket; protests to my husband he is now
here; and hath drawn him and the rest of their company from their
sport, to make another experiment of his suspicion. But I am glad
the knight is not here; now he shall see his own foolery.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

How near is he, Mistress Page?


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Hard by, at street end; he will be here anon.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

I am undone! the knight is here.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Why, then, you are utterly shamed, and he's but a dead man. What
a woman are you! Away with him, away with him! better shame than
murder.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Which way should he go? How should I bestow him? Shall I put him
into the basket again?


@d{}
[Re-enter Falstaff}


@e{"names":["Falstaff"]}

@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

No, I'll come no more i' the basket. May I not go out ere he come?


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Alas! three of Master Ford's brothers watch the door with pistols,
that none shall issue out; otherwise you might slip away ere he
came. But what make you here?


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

What shall I do? I'll creep up into the chimney.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

There they always use to discharge their birding-pieces.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Creep into the kiln-hole.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Where is it?


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

He will seek there, on my word. Neither press, coffer, chest, trunk,
well, vault, but he hath an abstract for the remembrance of such
places, and goes to them by his note: there is no hiding you in
the house.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

I'll go out then.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

If you go out in your own semblance, you die, Sir John. Unless
you go out disguised,--


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

How might we disguise him?


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Alas the day! I know not! There is no woman's gown big enough for
him; otherwise he might put on a hat, a muffler, and a kerchief,
and so escape.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Good hearts, devise something: any extremity rather than a mischief.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

My maid's aunt, the fat woman of Brainford, has a gown above.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

On my word, it will serve him; she's as big as he is; and there's
her thrummed hat, and her muffler too. Run up, Sir John.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Go, go, sweet Sir John. Mistress Page and I will look some linen
for your head.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Quick, quick! we'll come dress you straight; put on the gown the while.


@d{}
[Exit Falstaff]


@x{"names":["Falstaff"]}

@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

I would my husband would meet him in this shape; he cannot abide
the old woman of Brainford; he swears she's a witch, forbade her
my house, and hath threatened to beat her.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Heaven guide him to thy husband's cudgel; and the devil guide his
cudgel afterwards!


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

But is my husband coming?


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Ay, in good sadness is he; and talks of the basket too, howsoever
he hath had intelligence.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

We'll try that; for I'll appoint my men to carry the basket again,
to meet him at the door with it as they did last time.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Nay, but he'll be here presently; let's go dress him like the
witch of Brainford.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

I'll first direct my men what they shall do with the basket. Go up;
I'll bring linen for him straight.


@d{}
[Exit.]


@x{"names":["Mistress Ford"]}

@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Hang him, dishonest varlet! we cannot misuse him enough.
  We'll leave a proof, by that which we will do,
  Wives may be merry and yet honest too.
  We do not act that often jest and laugh;
  'Tis old but true: 'Still swine eats all the draff.'

@e{"names":["Ford","Page","Shallow","Doctor Caius","Evans"]}

@l{"name":"Ford"}

Ay, but if it prove true, Master Page, have you any way then to
unfool me again? Set down the basket, villain! Somebody call my
wife. Youth in a basket! O you panderly rascals! there's a knot,
a ging, a pack, a conspiracy against me. Now shall the devil be
shamed. What, wife, I say! Come, come forth! behold what honest
clothes you send forth to bleaching!


@l{"name":"Page"}

Why, this passes, Master Ford! you are not to go loose any longer;
you must be pinioned.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

Why, this is lunatics! this is mad as a mad dog.

Come hither, Mistress Ford, the honest woman, the modest wife,
the virtuous creature, that hath the jealous fool to her husband!
I suspect without cause, Mistress, do I?


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Heaven be my witness, you do, if you suspect me in any dishonesty.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Well said, brazen-face! hold it out. Come forth, sirrah.


@d{}
[Pulling clothes out of the basket.]


@l{"name":"Page"}

This passes!


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Are you not ashamed? Let the clothes alone.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

I shall find you anon.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

'Tis unreasonable. Will you take up your wife's clothes? Come away.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Empty the basket, I say!


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Why, man, why?


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Master Page, as I am a man, there was one conveyed out of my house
yesterday in this basket: why may not he be there again? In my
house I am sure he is; my intelligence is true; my jealousy is
reasonable. Pluck me out all the linen.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

If you find a man there, he shall die a flea's death.


@l{"name":"Page"}

Here's no man.


@l{"name":"Shallow"}

By my fidelity, this is not well, Master Ford; this wrongs you.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

Master Ford, you must pray, and not follow the imaginations of
your own heart; this is jealousies.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Well, he's not here I seek for.


@l{"name":"Page"}

No, nor nowhere else but in your brain.


@d{}
[Servants carry away the basket.]


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Help to search my house this one time. If I find not what I
seek, show no colour for my extremity; let me for ever be your
table-sport; let them say of me 'As jealous as Ford, that searched
a hollow walnut for his wife's leman.' Satisfy me once more; once
more search with me.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

What, hoa, Mistress Page! Come you and the old woman down; my
husband will come into the chamber.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Old woman? what old woman's that?


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Why, it is my maid's aunt of Brainford.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

A witch, a quean, an old cozening quean! Have I not forbid her
my house? She comes of errands, does she? We are simple men;
we do not know what's brought to pass under the profession of
fortune-telling. She works by charms, by spells, by the figure,
and such daubery as this is, beyond our element. We know nothing.
Come down, you witch, you hag you; come down, I say!


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Nay, good sweet husband! Good gentlemen, let him not strike the
old woman.

Nay, he will do it. 'Tis a goodly credit for you.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Hang her, witch!


@l{"name":"Evans"}

By yea and no, I think the 'oman is a witch indeed; I like not when
a 'oman has a great peard; I spy a great peard under her muffler.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Will you follow, gentlemen? I beseech you follow; see but the issue
of my jealousy; if I cry out thus upon no trail, never trust me
when I open again.


@l{"name":"Page"}

Trust me, he beat him most pitifully.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Nay, by the mass, that he did not; he beat him most unpitifully
methought.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

I'll have the cudgel hallowed and hung o'er the altar; it hath
done meritorious service.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

What think you? May we, with the warrant of womanhood and the
witness of a good conscience, pursue him with any further revenge?


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

The spirit of wantonness is sure scared out of him; if the devil
have him not in fee-simple, with fine and recovery, he will never,
I think, in the way of waste, attempt us again.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Shall we tell our husbands how we have served him?


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Yes, by all means; if it be but to scrape the figures out of
your husband's brains. If they can find in their hearts the poor
unvirtuous fat knight shall be any further afflicted, we two will
still be the ministers.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

I'll warrant they'll have him publicly shamed; and methinks there

@e{"names":["Ford","Page","Mistress Page","Mistress Ford","Evans"]}

@l{"name":"Evans"}

'Tis one of the best discretions of a 'oman as ever I did look upon.


@l{"name":"Page"}

And did he send you both these letters at an instant?


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Within a quarter of an hour.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Pardon me, wife. Henceforth, do what thou wilt;
I rather will suspect the sun with cold
Than thee with wantonness: now doth thy honour stand,
In him that was of late an heretic,
As firm as faith.


@l{"name":"Page"}

'Tis well, 'tis well; no more.
Be not as extreme in submission
As in offence;
But let our plot go forward: let our wives
Yet once again, to make us public sport,
Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow,
Where we may take him and disgrace him for it.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

There is no better way than that they spoke of.


@l{"name":"Page"}

How? To send him word they'll meet him in the park at midnight?
Fie, fie! he'll never come!


@l{"name":"Evans"}

You say he has been thrown in the rivers; and has been grievously
peaten as an old 'oman; methinks there should be terrors in him,
that he should not come; methinks his flesh is punished; he shall
have no desires.


@l{"name":"Page"}

So think I too.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Devise but how you'll use him when he comes,
And let us two devise to bring him thither.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter,
Sometime a keeper here in Windsor Forest,
Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,
Walk round about an oak, with great ragg'd horns;
And there he blasts the tree, and takes the cattle,
And makes milch-kine yield blood, and shakes a chain
In a most hideous and dreadful manner:
You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know
The superstitious idle-headed eld
Received, and did deliver to our age,
This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.


@l{"name":"Page"}

Why, yet there want not many that do fear
In deep of night to walk by this Herne's oak.
But what of this?


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Marry, this is our device;
That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us,
Disguis'd, like Herne, with huge horns on his head.


@l{"name":"Page"}

Well, let it not be doubted but he'll come,
And in this shape. When you have brought him thither,
What shall be done with him? What is your plot?


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

That likewise have we thought upon, and thus:
Nan Page my daughter, and my little son,
And three or four more of their growth, we'll dress
Like urchins, ouphs, and fairies, green and white,
With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,
And rattles in their hands. Upon a sudden,
As Falstaff, she, and I, are newly met,
Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once
With some diffused song; upon their sight
We two in great amazedness will fly:
Then let them all encircle him about,
And fairy-like, to pinch the unclean knight;
And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,
In their so sacred paths he dares to tread
In shape profane.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

And till he tell the truth,
Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound,
And burn him with their tapers.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

The truth being known,
We'll all present ourselves; dis-horn the spirit,
And mock him home to Windsor.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

The children must
Be practis'd well to this or they'll ne'er do 't.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

I will teach the children their behaviours; and I will
be like a jack-an-apes also, to burn the knight with my
taber.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

That will be excellent. I'll go buy them vizards.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

My Nan shall be the Queen of all the Fairies,
Finely attired in a robe of white.


@l{"name":"Page"}

That silk will I go buy. 
@d{}
[Aside.] 
@l{"name":"Page"}
And in that time
Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away,
And marry her at Eton. Go, send to Falstaff straight.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Nay, I'll to him again, in name of Brook;
He'll tell me all his purpose. Sure, he'll come.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Fear not you that. Go, get us properties
And tricking for our fairies.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

Let us about it. It is admirable pleasures, and fery
honest knaveries.

The Doctor is well money'd, and his friends
Potent at court: he, none but he, shall have her,

Marry, sir, I come to speak with Sir John Falstaff from Master Slender.


@l{"name":"Host"}

There's his chamber, his house, his castle, his standing-bed and
truckle-bed; 'tis painted about with the story of the Prodigal,
fresh and new. Go knock and call; he'll speak like an
Anthropophaginian unto thee; knock, I say.


@l{"name":"Simple"}

There's an old woman, a fat woman, gone up into his chamber; I'll
be so bold as stay, sir, till she come down; I come to speak with
her, indeed.


@l{"name":"Host"}

Ha! a fat woman? The knight may be robbed. I'll call. Bully knight!
Bully Sir John! Speak from thy lungs military. Art thou there? It
is thine host, thine Ephesian, calls.

There was, mine host, an old fat woman even now with, me; but
she's gone.


@l{"name":"Simple"}

Pray you, sir, was't not the wise woman of Brainford?


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Ay, marry was it, mussel-shell: what would you with her?


@l{"name":"Simple"}

My master, sir, my Master Slender, sent to her, seeing her go
thorough the streets, to know, sir, whether one Nym, sir, that
beguiled him of a chain, had the chain or no.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

I spake with the old woman about it.


@l{"name":"Simple"}

And what says she, I pray, sir?


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}
 
Marry, she says that the very same man that beguiled Master Slender
of his chain cozened him of it.


@l{"name":"Simple"}

I would I could have spoken with the woman herself; I had other
things to have spoken with her too, from him.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

What are they? Let us know.


@l{"name":"Host"}

Ay, come; quick.


@l{"name":"Simple"}

I may not conceal them, sir.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Conceal them, or thou diest.


@l{"name":"Simple"}

Why, sir, they were nothing but about Mistress Anne Page: to know
if it were my master's fortune to have her or no.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

'Tis, 'tis his fortune.


@l{"name":"Simple"}

What sir?


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

To have her, or no. Go; say the woman told me so.


@l{"name":"Simple"}

May I be bold to say so, sir?


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Ay, Sir Tike; like who more bold?


@l{"name":"Simple"}

I thank your worship; I shall make my master glad with these tidings.

neither, but was paid for my learning.

@l{"name":"Bardolph"}

Run away, with the cozeners; for so soon as I came beyond Eton,
they threw me off, from behind one of them, in a slough of mire;
and set spurs and away, like three German devils, three Doctor
Faustuses.

the hosts of Readins, of Maidenhead, of Colebrook, of horses and

I would all the world might be cozened, for I have been cozened and
beaten too. If it should come to the ear of the court how I have
been transformed, and how my transformation hath been washed and
cudgelled, they would melt me out of my fat, drop by drop, and
liquor fishermen's boots with me; I warrant they would whip me
with their fine wits till I were as crest-fallen as a dried pear.
I never prospered since I forswore myself at primero. Well, if my

From the two parties, forsooth.

The devil take one party and his dam the other! And so they shall
be both bestowed. I have suffered more for their sakes, more than
the villainous inconstancy of man's disposition is able to bear.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

And have not they suffered? Yes, I warrant; speciously one of them;
Mistress Ford, good heart, is beaten black and blue, that you
cannot see a white spot about her.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

What tellest thou me of black and blue? I was beaten myself into
all the colours of the rainbow; and was like to be apprehended for
the witch of Brainford. But that my admirable dexterity of wit,
my counterfeiting the action of an old woman, delivered me, the
knave constable had set me i' the stocks, i' the common stocks,
for a witch.


@l{"name":"Mistress Quickly"}

Sir, let me speak with you in your chamber; you shall hear how
things go, and, I warrant, to your content. Here is a letter will

Master Fenton, talk not to me; my mind is heavy; I will give over all.

Yet hear me speak. Assist me in my purpose,
And, as I am a gentleman, I'll give thee
A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.


@l{"name":"Host"}

I will hear you, Master Fenton; and I will, at the least, keep your
counsel.


@l{"name":"Fenton"}

From time to time I have acquainted you
With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page,
Who, mutually, hath answered my affection,
So far forth as herself might be her chooser,
Even to my wish. I have a letter from her
Of such contents as you will wonder at;
The mirth whereof so larded with my matter
That neither, singly, can be manifested
Without the show of both; wherein fat Falstaff
Hath a great scare: the image of the jest
I'll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host:
To-night at Herne's oak, just 'twixt twelve and one,
Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;
The purpose why is here: in which disguise,
While other jests are something rank on foot,
Her father hath commanded her to slip
Away with Slender, and with him at Eton
Immediately to marry; she hath consented:
Now, sir,
Her mother, even strong against that match
And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed
That he shall likewise shuffle her away,
While other sports are tasking of their minds;
And at the deanery, where a priest attends,
Straight marry her: to this her mother's plot
She seemingly obedient likewise hath
Made promise to the doctor. Now thus it rests:
Her father means she shall be all in white;
And in that habit, when Slender sees his time
To take her by the hand and bid her go,
She shall go with him: her mother hath intended
The better to denote her to the doctor,--
For they must all be mask'd and vizarded--
That quaint in green she shall be loose enrob'd,
With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head;
And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,
To pinch her by the hand: and, on that token,
The maid hath given consent to go with him.


@l{"name":"Host"}

Which means she to deceive, father or mother?


@l{"name":"Fenton"}

Both, my good host, to go along with me:
And here it rests, that you'll procure the vicar
To stay for me at church, 'twixt twelve and one,
And in the lawful name of marrying,
To give our hearts united ceremony.


@l{"name":"Host"}

Well, husband your device; I'll to the vicar.
Bring you the maid, you shall not lack a priest.


@l{"name":"Fenton"}

So shall I evermore be bound to thee;
Besides, I'll make a present recompense.

@l{"name":"Ford"}

Went you not to her yesterday, sir, as you told me you had appointed?


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

I went to her, Master Brook, as you see, like a poor old man; but
I came from her, Master Brook, like a poor old woman. That same
knave Ford, her husband, hath  the finest mad devil of jealousy
in him, Master Brook, that ever governed frenzy. I will tell you:
he beat me grievously in the shape of a woman; for in the shape
of man, Master Brook, I fear not Goliath with a weaver's beam,
because I know also life is a shuttle. I am in haste; go along
with me; I'll tell you all, Master Brook. Since I plucked geese,
played truant, and whipped top, I knew not what 'twas to be beaten
till lately. Follow me: I'll tell you strange things of this knave
Ford, on whom to-night I will be revenged, and I will deliver his
wife into your hand. Follow. Strange things in hand, Master Brook!

Ay, forsooth; I have spoke with her, and we have a nay-word how
to know one another. I come to her in white and cry 'mum'; she
cries 'budget,' and by that we know one another.

That's good too; but what needs either your 'mum' or her 'budget'?
The white will decipher her well enough. It hath struck ten o'clock.

The Windsor bell hath struck twelve; the minute draws on. Now the
hot-blooded gods assist me! Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for
thy Europa; love set on thy horns. O powerful love! that in some
respects, makes a beast a man; in some other a man a beast. You
were also, Jupiter, a swan, for the love of Leda. O omnipotent love!
how near the god drew to the complexion of a goose! A fault done
first in the form of a beast; O Jove, a beastly fault! and then
another fault in the semblance of a fowl: think on't, Jove, a foul
fault! When gods have hot backs what shall poor men do? For me,
I am here a Windsor stag; and the fattest, I think, i' the forest.
Send me a cool rut-time, Jove, or who can blame me to piss my tallow?
Who comes here? my doe?

Fairies, black, grey, green, and white,
You moonshine revellers, and shades of night,
You orphan heirs of fixed destiny,
Attend your office and your quality.
Crier Hobgoblin, make the fairy oyes.


@l{"name":"Pistol"}

Elves, list your names: silence, you airy toys!
Cricket, to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap:
Where fires thou find'st unrak'd, and hearths unswept,
There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry:
Our radiant Queen hates sluts and sluttery.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

They are fairies; he that speaks to them shall die:
I'll wink and couch: no man their works must eye.


@d{}

@l{"name":"Evans"}

Where's Bede? Go you, and where you find a maid
That, ere she sleep, has thrice her prayers said,
Rein up the organs of her fantasy,
Sleep she as sound as careless infancy;
But those as sleep and think not on their sins,
Pinch them, arms, legs, backs, shoulders, sides, and shins.


@l{"name":"Anne"}

About, about!
Search Windsor castle, elves, within and out:
Strew good luck, ouphes, on every sacred room,
That it may stand till the perpetual doom,
In state as wholesome as in state 'tis fit,
Worthy the owner and the owner it.
The several chairs of order look you scour
With juice of balm and every precious flower:
Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
With loyal blazon, evermore be blest!
And nightly, meadow-fairies, look you sing,
Like to the Garter's compass, in a ring:
The expressure that it bears, green let it be,
More fertile-fresh than all the field to see;
And 'Honi soit qui mal y pense' write
In emerald tufts, flowers purple, blue and white;
Like sapphire, pearl, and rich embroidery,
Buckled below fair knighthood's bending knee.
Fairies use flowers for their charactery.
Away! disperse! But, till 'tis one o'clock,
Our dance of custom round about the oak
Of Herne the hunter let us not forget.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

Pray you, lock hand in hand; yourselves in order set;
And twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be,
To guide our measure round about the tree.
But, stay; I smell a man of middle-earth.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy, lest he transform me
to a piece of cheese!


@l{"name":"Pistol"}

Vile worm, thou wast o'erlook'd even in thy birth.


@l{"name":"Anne"}

With trial-fire touch me his finger-end:
If he be chaste, the flame will back descend
And turn him to no pain; but if he start,
It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.

A trial! come.

Come, will this wood take fire?

SONG.

   
@l{"name":"Anne"}
Fie on sinful fantasy!
   Fie on lust and luxury!
   Lust is but a bloody fire,
   Kindled with unchaste desire,
   Fed in heart, whose flames aspire,
   As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.
   Pinch him, fairies, mutually;
   Pinch him for his villany;
   Pinch him and burn him and turn him about,
   Till candles and star-light and moonshine be out.

Will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn?


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher.
Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
See you these, husband? do not these fair yokes
Become the forest better than the town?


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Now, sir, who's a cuckold now? Master Brook, Falstaff's a knave,
a cuckoldly knave; here are his horns, Master Brook; and, Master
Brook, he hath enjoyed nothing of Ford's but his buck-basket,
his cudgel, and twenty pounds of money, which must be paid to
Master Brook; his horses are arrested for it, Master Brook.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never meet. I will never
take you for my love again; but I will always count you my deer.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Ay, and an ox too; both the proofs are extant.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

And these are not fairies? I was three or four times in the thought
they were not fairies; and yet the guiltiness of my mind, the
sudden surprise of my powers, drove the grossness of the foppery
into a received belief, in despite of the teeth of all rhyme and
reason, that they were fairies. See now how wit may be made a
Jack-a-Lent when 'tis upon ill employment!


@l{"name":"Evans"}

Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your desires, and fairies
will not pinse you.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Well said, fairy Hugh.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

And leave you your jealousies too, I pray you.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

I will never mistrust my wife again, till thou art able to woo her
in good English.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Have I laid my brain in the sun, and dried it, that it wants matter
to prevent so gross o'er-reaching as this? Am I ridden with a Welsh
goat too? Shall I have a cox-comb of frieze? 'Tis time I were
choked with a piece of toasted cheese.


@l{"name":"Evans"}

Seese is not good to give putter: your belly is all putter.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

'Seese' and 'putter'! Have I lived to stand at the taunt of one
that makes fritters of English? This is enough to be the decay
of lust and late-walking through the realm.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Why, Sir John, do you think, though we would have thrust virtue
out of our hearts by the head and shoulders, and have given
ourselves without scruple to hell, that ever the devil could
have made you our delight?


@l{"name":"Ford"}

What, a hodge-pudding? a bag of flax?


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

A puffed man?


@l{"name":"Page"}

Old, cold, withered, and of intolerable entrails?

And one that is as slanderous as Satan?


@l{"name":"Page"}

And as poor as Job?


@l{"name":"Ford"}

And as wicked as his wife?


@l{"name":"Evans"}

And given to fornications, and to taverns, and sack and wine, and
metheglins, and to drinkings and swearings and starings, pribbles
and prabbles?


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

Well, I am your theme; you have the start of me; I am dejected;
I am not able to answer the Welsh flannel. Ignorance itself is
a plummet o'er me; use me as you will.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Marry, sir, we'll bring you to Windsor, to one Master Brook, that
you have cozened of money, to whom you should have been a pander:
over and above that you have suffered, I think to repay that money
will be a biting affliction.


@l{"name":"Mistress Ford"}

Nay, husband, let that go to make amends;
Forget that sum, so we'll all be friends.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Well, here's my hand: all is forgiven at last.

Yet be cheerful, knight; thou shalt eat a posset tonight at my
house; where I will desire thee to laugh at my wife, that now
laughs at thee. Tell her, Master Slender hath married her daughter.

I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page, and she's a
great lubberly boy: if it had not been i' the church, I would

a postmaster's boy.


@l{"name":"Page"}

Upon my life, then, you took the wrong.


@l{"name":"Slender"}

What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took a boy for a
girl. If I had been married to him, for all he was in woman's
apparel, I would not have had him.


@l{"name":"Page"}

Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how you should
know my daughter by her garments?


@l{"name":"Slender"}

I went to her in white and cried 'mum' and she cried 'budget'
as Anne and I had appointed; and yet it was not Anne, but a
postmaster's boy.

Jeshu! Master Slender, cannot you see put marry poys?


@l{"name":"Page"}

O I am vexed at heart: what shall I do?

@e{"names":["Doctor Caius"]}

@l{"name":"Doctor Caius"}

Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened; I ha' married un
garcon, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy; it is not Anne Page;
by gar, I am cozened.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Why, did you take her in green?


@l{"name":"Doctor Caius"}

Ay, by gar, and 'tis a boy: by gar, I'll raise all Windsor.

[Exit.]

@l{"name":"Ford"}

This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?


@l{"name":"Page"}

My heart misgives me; here comes Master Fenton.


@d{}
[Enter FENTON and ANNE Page]


@e{"names":["Anne","Fenton"]}

@l{"name":"Page"}
How now, Master Fenton!


@l{"name":"Anne"}

Pardon, good father! good my mother, pardon!


@l{"name":"Page"}

Now, Mistress, how chance you went not with Master Slender?


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Why went you not with Master Doctor, maid?


@l{"name":"Fenton"}

You do amaze her: hear the truth of it.
You would have married her most shamefully,
Where there was no proportion held in love.
The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,
Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.
The offence is holy that she hath committed,
And this deceit loses the name of craft,
Of disobedience, or unduteous title,
Since therein she doth evitate and shun
A thousand irreligious cursed hours,
Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Stand not amaz'd: here is no remedy:
In love, the heavens themselves do guide the state:
Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

I am glad, though you have ta'en a special stand
to strike at me, that your arrow hath glanced.


@l{"name":"Page"}

Well, what remedy?--Fenton, heaven give thee joy!
What cannot be eschew'd must be embrac'd.


@l{"name":"Falstaff"}

When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chas'd.


@l{"name":"Mistress Page"}

Well, I will muse no further. Master Fenton,
Heaven give you many, many merry days!
Good husband, let us every one go home,
And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire;
Sir John and all.


@l{"name":"Ford"}

Let it be so. Sir John,
To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word;
For he, to-night, shall lie with Mistress Ford.
